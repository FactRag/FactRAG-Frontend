However, it does not provide information about the origin of its name.\n* Another document states that Aster has beautiful natural landscapes surrounding it, including the Mill Creek Ravine and the North Saskatchewan River valley.\n\nBased on these findings:\n\nThe triple is partially correct as \"Aster\" is indeed a neighborhood in Edmonton, Alberta, but it's not explicitly stated to be named after the Aster genus of flowering plants.\n\nHowever, considering that there are mentions of natural landscapes surrounding the community, including the Mill Creek Ravine and the North Saskatchewan River valley, which have flowers and plants, one could make an educated guess that the neighborhood might indeed be inspired by or named after a specific type of plant. However, this is not explicitly stated in any of the documents.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe answer is:\n```json\n{'output': 'no'}\n```\n\nPlease note that this evaluation was based on the provided context information and without prior knowledge."
