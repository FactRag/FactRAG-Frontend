            "full_ans": "Based on the provided context information, I will evaluate whether the statement \"Gerald Maxwell served from 1914\" is supported by the documents.\n\nHere's the evaluation:\n\n* The first document mentions that Gerald Maxwell returned to England on October 21, 1917, which indicates that he served at least until then. However, it does not provide information about his service start date.\n* The second and fourth documents mention that Gerald Maxwell was commissioned in the Lovat Scouts on August 4, 1914, but they do not explicitly state that this is when he started serving.\n* The third document mentions that Gerald Maxwell served in World War I, but it does not provide a specific start date for his service.\n* The fifth document mentions that Gerald Maxwell was commissioned in the Lovat Scouts on August 4, 1914, and that he fought at Gallipoli. However, it also mentions that he transferred to the RFC in September 1916.\n\nBased on this information, I can conclude that the statement \"Gerald Maxwell served from 1914\" is partially supported by the documents, but it might not be entirely accurate. He did serve in World War I and was commissioned in 1914, but it's unclear if he started serving immediately in August 1914 or began serving later.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

This indicates his service began in 1914."
