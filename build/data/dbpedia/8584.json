However, it mentions that a new version of Autopackage has improved C++ support. This suggests that Autopackage is capable of handling C++ packages, but it does not necessarily mean that it \"uses\" C++.\n\nIn the text from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8584/re-ranker-msmarco/16.txt, it says: \"The most important enhancement in the new 1.2 version is the improved C++ support...\". This implies that Autopackage has been enhanced to better support C++ packages, but it does not indicate that Autopackage itself uses C++."
