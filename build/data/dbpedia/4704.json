For example, in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4704/re-ranker-msmarco/64.txt, it says \"K1 Speed is the United States' largest indoor kart racing operator...\". Similarly, in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4704/re-ranker-msmarco/56.txt, it mentions \"ABOUT K1 SPEED\" and \"For more information about K1 Speed, visit www.k1speed.com\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is affirmative."
