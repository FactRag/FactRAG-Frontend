While it mentions that Serbia is divided into 145 municipalities, 28 cities, and the City of Belgrade, this does not imply that La\u0111evci is a type of municipality or city. The documents describe various aspects of Serbian geography, politics, and culture but do not explicitly link La\u0111evci to these broader categories."

Since La\u0111evci is described as a town within the Srbija region, it aligns with being part of these local self-government units, supporting the statement that La\u0111evci is a type of municipality or city in Serbia."
