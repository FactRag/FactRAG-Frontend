He has made appearances for Exeter City and Fulham.\n* However, there are no mentions of \"Wally Harris\" playing for Birmingham City F.C.\n\nConsidering the information provided, I would say that the triple \"Wally Harris (footballer) played for Birmingham City F.C.\" is not supported by the documents.
