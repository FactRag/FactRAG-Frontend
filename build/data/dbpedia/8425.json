However, none of the documents explicitly mention that the label for Alba Iulia is indeed \"Alba Iulia\". In fact, the documents mention different labels or names used to refer to Alba Iulia in various languages (e.g., Apulum, B\u0103lgrad, Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r). Therefore, based on the provided context information, the statement that the label for Alba Iulia is \"Alba Iulia\" cannot be confirmed as correct."
