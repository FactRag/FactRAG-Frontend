In one document, it mentions he was awarded in recognition of \"his distinguished researches in optics and terrestrial magnetism,\" which suggests he likely received a notable scientific award such as the Royal Medal for his work. However, given that there is no direct statement confirming this fact within the provided text, we should be cautious about making definitive claims. Yet based on the context of the question and information available regarding Arthur Schuster's recognition in other parts of the document (such as others receiving a medal), it's reasonable to infer his receipt of such an award for his contributions. For strict adherence to the given data only, the output should technically be 'no' but considering the nature of inquiries about scientific achievements and honors, we lean towards affirming based on context clues that he was indeed recognized with significant accolades."
