This indicates that it has elements of both genres, but does not exclusively belong to the horror genre.\n* The plot summaries and descriptions provided in the documents highlight the film's themes of sci-fi and horror, including the mysterious \"blackout\" and the birth of psychic children with nihilistic tendencies. These details suggest that the film is more accurately described as a science fiction-horror film rather than just a horror film."
