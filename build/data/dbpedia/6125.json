To evaluate this, I'll look for information about the genre and nationality of the film.\n\nHere are some relevant findings from the documents:\n\n* The films are consistently described as \"musical romantic comedy\" (e.g., in 179.txt, 38.txt, 110.txt, 130.txt, and 131.txt), which implies a romantic comedy genre.\n* There is no information that suggests the film's primary focus is on American teen romance. While it does feature an American cast and crew, the films' descriptions emphasize their musical and comedic elements rather than focusing specifically on romance or teenage themes.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would conclude that the triple is incorrect.
