In one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2337/re-ranker-msmarco/95.txt), it is stated that \"The Battle of Pancorbo was a battle that took place in Napoleon's invasion of Spain.\" However, there is no explicit mention of the combatant for this specific battle.\n* Another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2337/re-ranker-msmarco/72.txt) mentions that Marshal Lefebvre's IV Corps fell upon Blake's 19,000 men at Pancorbo, which was a Spanish army under Lieutenant General Joaqu\u00edn Blake.
