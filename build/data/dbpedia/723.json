However, one of the documents mentions that the Jerusalem Lodge No. 90 Masonic body was formed in October 1850 and initially met in a temporary location in a downtown office building.\n\nSince this information is related to the \"Jerusalem Lodge No. 90\", but not explicitly mentioning its location as Aurora, Illinois, we can infer that it might be different from the Illinois Masonic Temple mentioned later.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation of the triple would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThis is because while there are documents related to both the Jerusalem Lodge No. 90 and the Illinois Masonic Temple in Aurora, they seem to refer to different entities."
