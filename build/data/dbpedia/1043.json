In particular, it states that the head of the Royal Australian Navy is the Monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II), and the professional head is the Chief of the Navy who holds the rank Vice-Admiral.\n\nOne document specifically mentions \"The present Chief is Vice-Admiral Ray Griggs. He was appointed in 2011.\" and another one states that the \"Chief of Navy\" is Vice Admiral Michael Noonan.\n\nThese statements imply that the Chief of Navy (Australia) is indeed associated with the Royal Australian Navy, supporting the triple: \"The subject of Chief of Navy (Australia) is Royal Australian Navy\"."
