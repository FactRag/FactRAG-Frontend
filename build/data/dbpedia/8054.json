The documents do mention an old Chinese wind rose with inverted kwaes, and a Royal Korean Consulate flag with a different arrangement of trigraphs, but there is no clear information on the specific arrangement of 8 kwaes or their change occurring in 1910-1883.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information:\n\n**Response:** {'output': 'no'}"
