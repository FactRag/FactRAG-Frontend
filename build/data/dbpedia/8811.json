According to one of the documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8811/re-ranker-msmarco/42.txt), William Zeckendorf Sr. died on September 30, 1976 is incorrect as it actually says \"d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 30 septembre 1976\" which means he died on September 30, 1976 (in the document of the father) and another one says William Zeckendorf Jr. who died on February 12, 2014 (in the document of his son), but it does not provide information about the death date of William Zeckendorf Sr."

He was 84.\" This indicates that William Zeckendorf Jr. died on a specific date, but the exact date is not provided among the given documents. Moreover, the information about his death location and age are different from what might be inferred or stated incorrectly in the query. The correct statement of his death should be based on the details available in `7.txt`, which mentions \"February 12, 2014,\" for William Zeckendorf Jr.'s death date. Therefore, the provided query is not supported by the given documents."
