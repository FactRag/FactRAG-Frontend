Specifically:\n\n* In file_path 4.txt, it says \"Funkdoobiest is an American rap group from Los Angeles, California.\"\n* In file_path 9.txt, it says \"Funkdoobiest is a Native American rap group from Los Angeles, California.\" (Note: While this mentions \"Native American\", the context suggests that they are being referred to as such due to Tomahawk Funk's heritage, not the entire group. The first mention in file_path 4.txt explicitly states they are \"American\".)\n* In other documents, the country of origin is mentioned as \"Los Angeles, California\" without specifying a nationality.\n\nConsidering this information, I conclude that:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'yes'}"
