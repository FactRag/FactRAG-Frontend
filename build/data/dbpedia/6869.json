Kennedy's presidency, but none of them mention the defense ending in 1963. In fact, document 67.txt mentions that Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, which implies that his presidency did not end until then. However, it does not provide any information about when or if the defense ended during his presidency.\n\nDocument 17.txt mentions the containment doctrine and the implementation of a new defense strategy, but it does not mention the defense ending in 1963. Document 47.txt discusses Kennedy's policies on the Cold War, but again, there is no mention of the defense ending in 1963."
