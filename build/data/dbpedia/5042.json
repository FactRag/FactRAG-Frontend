Since the query states that \"The subject of The Automatic is British indie rock groups,\" and given that The Automatic is indeed considered a British indie rock band (though not explicitly mentioned in the provided context), the statement aligns with the overall theme discussed in the documents, even though direct confirmation from the texts isn't present. Therefore, based on the context and without prior knowledge suggesting otherwise, the answer can be \"yes.\""
