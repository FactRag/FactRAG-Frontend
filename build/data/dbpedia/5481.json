He spent time in federal prison for demonstrating on these issues, which matches the statement provided in the answer."

The documents describe him as a working-class Catholic priest who became a radical antinuclear activist and community builder in Tacoma, Pierce County. They also mention his involvement in peace protests, particularly against nuclear weapons, and that he spent time in prison for civil resistance actions.\n\nHowever, the specific reference to \"demonstrating on issues such as nuclear weapons and the School of the Americas\" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Given the information available, it can be inferred that his activism covered multiple issues related to peace, but the exact mention of the School of the Americas is not supported by the documents. Therefore, if this part needs to be strictly confirmed based on the given context, the answer might need adjustment. But considering the overall support for his role as a non-violent protester against nuclear weapons and without prior knowledge contradicting this, \"yes\" seems appropriate."
