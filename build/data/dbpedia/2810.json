Miller who died in Stockton, California, in 2004 (not mentioned in this context).\n* A comic artist named Frank Miller who died in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1949.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that there are multiple individuals with the name \"Frank Miller\", and the first document's statement about a Frank Miller dying in San Francisco might be referring to one of these other individuals.
