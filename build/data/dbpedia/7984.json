In fact, one document mentions Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) as the metropolis of the whole Pannonia, which suggests that it may have been a more central or important location than Siscia. Therefore, based on the information provided, the triple \"Pannonia Savia has Sisak as its capital\" is not supported by the documents."
