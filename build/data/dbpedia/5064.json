There are no gates at commuter rail stations or at subway stations.\" but this does not provide information about electrification type.\n\nDocument 7 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5064/re-ranker-msmarco/91.txt) mentions that \"The most usual tram types in the Helsinki transport are domestic articulated tram tramcars (series NRV I and MLNRV II) made in the 1980s...\" but this does not provide information about electrification type.\n\nDocument 1 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5064/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt) lists different types of power supply systems, including overhead line voltage for Helsinki tram. However, this document is a list and not a direct statement about the electrification type of Helsinki tram.\n\nBased on these documents, we can conclude that while there are mentions of overhead lines in relation to trams, it's not explicitly stated that the electrification type for Helsinki tram is \"Overhead line\". Thus:\n\n`{ 'output': 'no' }`"

Therefore, the statement that the type of electrification for Helsinki trams is an Overhead line is supported by the provided context."
