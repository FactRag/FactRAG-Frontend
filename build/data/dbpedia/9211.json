However, they do not explicitly state that the currency of the Kingdom of Hungary is Thaler. In fact, one document mentions that the name \"forint\" comes from Florence, where gold coins known as fiorino d'oro have been struck since 1252, suggesting a connection between the forint and the fiorino d'oro, but not with the thaler. Another document does mention Maria Theresa thalers being in common use in Aden and some other parts of the Middle East, but it does not imply that the Kingdom of Hungary used Thalers as its official currency. Therefore, the information provided does not support the triple \"The currency of the Kingdom of Hungary is Thaler\"."
