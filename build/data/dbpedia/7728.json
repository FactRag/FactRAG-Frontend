It actually states that she was born in Norway and died in 2024, which is inconsistent with the information provided in other documents.\n* However, upon closer inspection of the context information, I found that there are multiple documents mentioning different people named Inger Elliott or Inger McCabe Elliott. One document (path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7728/re-ranker-msmarco/45.txt) mentions a person named Osborn Elliott, who is related to an Inger McCabe Elliott, and it states that Inger McCabe Elliott was born in 1933.\n* Another document (path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7728/re-ranker-msmarco/4.txt) mentions a person named Inger Elliott with different birth years and facts. However, this is likely referring to a different person or the same person but with incorrect information.\n* Given that there are multiple documents mentioning different people with similar names, it's difficult to determine which one refers to the correct Inger McCabe Elliott without more context.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, I cannot definitively confirm whether the triple is correct or not. However, if we consider the first document as a primary source, it seems to suggest that the birthplace of Inger McCabe Elliott might be Norway, which makes the triple \"yes\". But this answer should be taken with caution, as there are inconsistencies and multiple documents mentioning different people."
