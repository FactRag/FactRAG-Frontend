Additionally, it's mentioned that the band is managed by ROAR, a talent and brand management company. However, there is no direct information about Bigger Picture Music Group being distributed by Atlantic Records.\n\nBut, in another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5077/re-ranker-msmarco/123.txt), it's mentioned that Big Beat Records, a label owned by Warner Music Group, \"operates through Atlantic Records\". This suggests a relationship between Warner Music Group and Atlantic Records, which might imply that Bigger Picture Music Group (if it exists) could be distributed by Atlantic Records as part of this larger music group structure.\n\nHowever, I'll note that the documents don't explicitly mention Bigger Picture Music Group being distributed by Atlantic Records. The correct answer should reflect the lack of direct information supporting the triple.\n\nTo be more precise:\n\nThe document does not provide explicit information about Bigger Picture Music Group's distribution deal with Atlantic Records. However, it does establish a connection between Warner Music Group and Atlantic Records through Big Beat Records.\n\nSo, I'll revise my response to indicate that the documents do not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute the triple directly.\n\n`{'output': 'maybe'}` (I couldn't definitively say yes or no)"

While direct distribution details are not explicitly stated, the context suggests that there is an ongoing relationship or deal with Atlantic Records, supporting the triple."
