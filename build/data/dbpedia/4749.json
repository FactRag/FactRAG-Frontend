However, the context suggests that Newark Liberty International Airport is a major airport with several airlines serving it, including United Airlines which is mentioned as having a key hub there. Given this information, it is likely that other airlines, such as Shuttle America, also have connections or serve passengers to and from Newark Liberty Airport."
