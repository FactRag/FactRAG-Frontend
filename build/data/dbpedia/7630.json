However, one of the documents mentions that Richter's landscapes are resonant in the context of his ambiguous relationship with the romantic tradition in German art, and a connection between Richter and Friedrich can stress the interest of both artists in landscape as an act of obstructing the view.\n\nIn document 4, it is mentioned that Ivo Mesquita curated the exhibition \u201cDesire in the Academy 1847-1916\u201d, which might imply some association with Romanticism. However, this connection is not explicitly stated and seems to be related more to the context of the exhibition rather than to Mesquita's personal style or interests.\n\nIn document 34, it is mentioned that Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita studied amongst others with Lambertus Zijl, who is also considered one of the most important and original representatives of the Dutch arts-and-crafts movement. This could imply a connection between these artists and Romanticism, but this information does not directly support or contradict the triple.\n\nOverall, considering the provided context information, it seems that the information in the documents supports the association with Romanticism, even if only indirectly."

However, for a definitive \"yes\" based on explicit information, additional sources would be needed to directly confirm his association with Romanticism. The query aligns with the broader context of artists and their work during that period, thus supporting an inference-based \"yes.\""
