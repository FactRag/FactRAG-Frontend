This suggests that there might be some confusion or association between the names \"Kenji Fujimori\" and \"Kenji Misawa\".\n\nAdditionally, in another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1234/re-ranker-msmarco/38.txt), Kenji Gerardo Fujimori Higuchi's name is mentioned as having the Japanese reading \"Fujimori Kenji\", which might be related to his given name.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that the context information does not clearly support or reject the statement that the given name of Kenji Fujimori is Kenji. Therefore:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
