The titles of other files (e.g., \"deliver us from evil\") are mentioned, but they do not appear to be directly related to the 2006 film about Roman Catholic Church sex abuse cases in the United States.\n\nThe documents also mention that the film is a \"hybrid of the horror, crime and 'based on a true story' genres\" and is adapted from a book by Ralph Sarchie. However, this information does not contradict the statement about the subject matter of the 2006 film.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is affirmative."

They discuss a documentary titled \"Deliver Us From Evil\" which focuses on the case of Oliver O'Grady, a pedophile priest who was part of the Catholic clergy, and his abuse of children in California. This aligns with the film being about Roman Catholic Church sex abuse cases in the United States."
