This implies that it is indeed a film from the 1964 category.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, we can see that the correct category for \"The Forest of the Hanged\" is actually http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Romanian_films or perhaps more specifically, http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_directed_by_Liviu_Ciulei, but not necessarily 1964 films in general.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would conclude that the triple \"The Forest of the Hanged is about http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:1964_films\" is **not** entirely accurate based on the information provided.
