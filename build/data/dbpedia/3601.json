However, the first mention in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3601/re-ranker-msmarco/134.txt actually says that Luis Congo is 50 years old (born on 1970-01-01) and his FIFA Nation is Ecuador, which might suggest he was born in Ecuador. However, the other documents contradict this statement, so I conclude that the triple \"Luis Congo was born in Ecuador\" is not supported by the context information."
