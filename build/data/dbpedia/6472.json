However, one document mentions that he was \"born and raised in Southern California\", which implies that his birthplace might be in the Los Angeles area, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be confirmed that Brad Sherman's birthplace is indeed Los Angeles."
