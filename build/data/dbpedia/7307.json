However, it also explicitly states that the \"Type\" is \"Privately Held\". This suggests that Landsbankinn indeed meets all three criteria to be considered privately held according to its characteristics as described in the provided documents.\n\nNote: The document contains multiple sections for Landsbankinn with slightly different information, but the \"Type\" field consistently refers to it as \"Privately Held\", which supports the conclusion."
