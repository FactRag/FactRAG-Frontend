None of the documents mention a \"Novorossiya Governorate\" or its capital. However, one document mentions Kirovohrad as the first capital of a governorate (the name is not specified), but it was later moved to Kremenchug in 1765. There is no indication that Kirovohrad was ever the capital of a \"Novorossiya Governorate\"."
