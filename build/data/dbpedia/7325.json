However, they do not mention any label (in the context of record labels) associated with Barry Gibb other than Columbia Records for his recent album. There is no information given that would support or refute the claim that \"Barry Gibbs\" as a label is synonymous with him personally; thus, based on the provided documents, the statement cannot be confirmed and therefore is considered incorrect in this context."
