In fact, one of the documents explicitly states that Setos are an ethnic group with their own distinctive identity and language, but also mentions that most Estonians speak standard Estonian, which differs significantly from the South Estonian languages like V\u00f5ro and Seto."

The documents indicate that Estonian is widely spoken and that there are efforts to preserve minority languages like Seto and V\u00f5ro, but this does not confirm the Seto dialect as the language of Estonia."
