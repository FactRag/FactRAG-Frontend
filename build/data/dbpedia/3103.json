While there are several mentions of the film \"Auntie Mame\", its category or type is not explicitly mentioned as being based on an American novel. However, it is mentioned that the book by Patrick Dennis (the real name of Edward Everett Tanner III) was a popular success in Italy and that Auntie Mame became a Broadway musical, suggesting that it may be based on an American work, but this information alone does not confirm that it is based on an American novel."
