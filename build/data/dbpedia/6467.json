In fact, one document mentions that the Head of State does not have to worry about the end of his term after 5 years, implying a different system of government. Another document mentions the \"Monarchy of Kyivan Rus'\" in the context of its relationship with the Church, but this is more related to the concept of anointing by God rather than indicating that Kievan Rus' was a monarchy in the classical sense."
