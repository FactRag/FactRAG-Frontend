This suggests that he was indeed billed by someone or something, but specifically who is not explicitly mentioned in the documents.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the documents, it appears that Randy Colley (also known as Moondog Rex) and Barry Darsow were part of a team called Demolition, with Randy being replaced by Barry. Later on, we see that Bill Eadie mentions working with \"Barry\" in an interview.\n\nWhile the information does not explicitly state that Barry Darsow was billed by someone or something, the context implies that he was likely billed as part of a team or duo, such as Demolition.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that the triple is:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'yes'}"
