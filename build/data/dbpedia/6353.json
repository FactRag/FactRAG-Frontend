However, there's no specific mention of \"Cotton College State University\" being a public university. In fact, one of the documents refers to \"Cotton College State University\" as one of the entities that was merged with Cotton College to form Cotton University.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I couldn't find any direct evidence to confirm whether Cotton College State University is a public university or not."
