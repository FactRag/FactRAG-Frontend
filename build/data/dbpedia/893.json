However, please note that I have some ambiguity with file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_893/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt since it mentions \"Delta Groove Music\" instead of \"Delta Groove Productions\", but the context implies a strong connection between the two.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{'output': 'yes'}"

This supports that Bob Corritore records for Delta Groove Productions."
