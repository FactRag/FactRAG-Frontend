The text states that the name of the engine was kept after the lead character Jade in the game Beyond Good and Evil, which suggests a strong connection between the engine and the game. Furthermore, the documents mention that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is being developed using the Jade engine, implying that the game is associated with the engine. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that Beyond Good & Evil is indeed a subject of the Jade (game engine) games category, and the answer is \"yes\"."
