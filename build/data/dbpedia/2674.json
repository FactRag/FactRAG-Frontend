However, this document does not state that Robert Flemyng is a star of the film. In fact, it only mentions him as one of the cast members.\n\nHowever, according to document 57 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2674/re-ranker-msmarco/57.txt), Robert Flemyng is indeed a member of the cast, but there's no indication that he's a star.\n\nTo make sure I'm correct in my response, I should look at all the documents again, and see if any of them explicitly state that Robert Flemyng is a star of The Blue Lamp."
