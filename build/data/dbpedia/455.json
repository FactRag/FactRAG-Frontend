Playing mainly with its B-side after having begun with Real Madrid C, he received his first-team debut on 8 May 1999, as a late substitute in a 2\u20133 away loss against Real Sociedad.\"\n\nThe document mentions that Tote joined Real Madrid's youth ranks and played with the B-side (also known as Real Madrid Castilla), but it does not confirm whether this was after being promoted to the main squad or if it was specifically for the B-team. However, the document also contains a separate entry about a match-worn shirt belonging to Antonio G\u00f3mez, who played for Real Madrid's first team and wore number 27, while wearing number 7 in the B-team.\n\nThe information does suggest that Tote might have played for the Real Madrid Castilla (B-side), but it is not definitive. However, given the context of Jorge L\u00f3pez Marco, also known as Tote being part of Real Madrid's youth ranks and later playing for other teams like H\u00e9rcules, Valladolid, Betis, M\u00e1laga and others, it seems plausible that he could have played for the B-side team at some point.\n\nGiven this information, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
