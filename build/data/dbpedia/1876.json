For example, from document `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1876/re-ranker-msmarco/97.txt`:\n\n\"Despite this, he resolved to join the Navy, and was commissioned as a lieutenant on 25 March 1798.\"\n\nThis information suggests that Andrew Sterett worked for the United States Navy, not the United States Merchant Marines."
