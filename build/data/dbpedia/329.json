The document file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_329/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt mentions John Willis as someone who \"developed applications\" and is also key person associated with Techtron in the context of AAS, not Alan Walsh."

Specifically, from `53.txt`, we learn that Mr. Frew worked closely with Alan Walsh, who was \u201cthe originator and developer of the atomic absorption method of chemical analysis.\u201d Additionally, his publication in 1955 is referenced as a cornerstone of modern AAS, further supporting his involvement in its invention or development."
