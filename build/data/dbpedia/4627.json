Later, the text mentions that Montenegrins are a topic of discussion in the book, and one author suggests that Montenegrins might be a branch of the Serbian nation or a distinct nation. However, this does not contradict the initial statement about Koprivica's ethnicity being Yugoslavian. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Bo\u017eo Koprivica's ethnicity is indeed related to Montenegro and Yugoslavia, supporting the triple."
