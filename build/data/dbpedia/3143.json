While one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3143/re-ranker-msmarco/134.txt) mentions that it was properly established under the Tudors, and Queen Elizabeth I has been credited with founding the Westminster School in 1560, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3143/re-ranker-msmarco/75.txt) states that the school was first founded by Henry VIII. However, it also mentions that Elizabeth I re-founded the school in 1560, making Elizabeth I a co-founder, rather than the sole founder. Therefore, the statement that Westminster School was founded by Henry VIII of England is not entirely accurate according to the documents."
