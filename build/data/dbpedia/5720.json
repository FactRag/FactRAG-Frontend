However, only one document (4.txt) mentions a Bill Johnson who is an editor and columnist for the Denver Post.\n\nIn this document, it is mentioned that \"Bill Johnson, one of the highest profile writers to join the Denver Post after the death of the Rocky Mountain News, has resigned from his position as columnist with the paper.\"\n\nThe other documents (119.txt, 11.txt, and 131.txt) mention a Bill Johnson who is a television director, pastor, or minister, but there is no clear connection between these individuals and the editor/columnist mentioned in document 4.txt.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of document 61.txt, it mentions that \"Bill Johnson was one of the 20 House Republicans\" honored by Retirsafe, which suggests that this Bill Johnson might be related to politics and not editing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of clear connection between the different documents, it's difficult to confirm with certainty that the name of the editor/columnist mentioned in document 4.txt is indeed \"Bill Johnson\". However, based on the available information, I would say:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
