The only information about justices appointed during his time (1841-1845) is related to other justices, but not specifically to him as a presiding authority over appointments.\n\nIn the 1840s, 4 Justices were appointed:\n\nDaniel, Peter Vivian\n\nNelson, Samuel\n\nWoodbury, Levi\n\nGrier, Robert Cooper\n\nThis period saw significant changes in the Supreme Court's composition, but Henry Brockholst is not mentioned. The provided context focuses on various aspects of the Supreme Court justices' history, such as their tenure, name frequencies, decade-wise appointments, religious affiliations, and notable events during their terms, but does not specifically connect these to Brockholst's presidency.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the answer to the triple is \"no\"."
