The texts repeatedly emphasize St. Bernard's devotion to Jesus Christ and Mary, his Mother. The repeated references to these two figures as central to his teachings and spirituality suggest that St. Bernard's primary concern was indeed with Jesus Christ and Mary Most Holy.\n\nIn particular, several documents mention St. Bernard's frequent invocation of the name of Jesus, his emphasis on the importance of prayer and contemplation centered around Jesus and Mary, and his view of Mary as a mediator and guide to her son Jesus. This consistent theme throughout the texts supports the conclusion that St. Bernard's teachings were primarily about Jesus Christ and Mary Most Holy."
