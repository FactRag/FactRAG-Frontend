The text mentions that he became the deputy general secretary of the GMB in 1991-96, treasurer of the Labour Party in 1992-96, and helped stabilise the party and lay the foundations for Labour's massive success in 1997, but it does not explicitly state that his activity as Baron Burlison started in 1992. Therefore, the answer is \"no\"."
