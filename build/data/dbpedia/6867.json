Kennedy is '--11-10'\".\n\nHere's my evaluation:\n\nThe documents contain various descriptions and facts about John F. Kennedy, but none of them match the format \"--11-10\". The relevant sentences from the documents are:\n\n* \"John F. Kennedy (May 29, 1917\u2013Nov. 22, 1963), the first U.S. president born in the 20th century...\"\n* \"He was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas, while beginning his 1964 re-election campaign.\"\n* \"John Fitzgerald 'Jack' Kennedy (May 29, 1917 \u2013 November 22, 1963), commonly known by his initials JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until he was assassinated in November 1963.\"\n\nThese sentences do not match the format \"--11-10\", which suggests a date or age range. Therefore, I conclude that the information in the documents does not support the triple \"The description of John F. Kennedy is '--11-10'\".\n\nHere's my response in the requested structured JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
