One document mentions that the Central Urikhtau field is expected to yield around 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year, and another document mentions that the Western Prorva and Kalamkas fields are scheduled to start production in 2027, but this does not provide information about the start date of the Urikhtau gas field. Therefore, the statement \"The Urikhtau gas field started production in 1984\" is unsupported by the provided documents."
