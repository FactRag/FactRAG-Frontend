Instead, she is described as one of the most powerful women in British and Tudor history, Queen of England and Ireland from 1558 to 1603, and a monarch of the Tudor dynasty. While it's true that she lived in the 16th century (which includes part of the 17th century), her subject is more specifically related to her historical context as a British and Tudor queen."
