The query asks whether *Copelatus mathani* belongs to the family *Dytiscidae*, which can be inferred from the context provided, even though the exact name \"mathani\" is not mentioned. Since all species listed (e.g., *Copelatus ateles*, *Copelatus elutus*, etc.) are explicitly stated as part of the family *Dytiscidae*, it is reasonable to conclude that this applies to other members of the genus as well."
