However, it is mentioned that he was an emeritus board member in 1992 and had spent nearly two decades in the New York State Assembly, which ended in 1978. This suggests that Perry B. Duryea, Jr. died after 1978, but before 1992. The document with file path `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1448/re-ranker-msmarco/7.txt` also mentions that he was born in 1933 and died at the age of 82, which would be after 1982.
