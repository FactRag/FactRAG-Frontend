Another document mentions that pensions are now paid in Rubles by the self-declared DPR government. These statements suggest that the currency of Donetsk People's Republic is not solely the Ukrainian hryvna."

For instance, from `24.txt`: \"Hryvnia supply is wearing thin. We have allowed the circulation of some foreign currencies, including the dollar, the euro and the yuan.\" And from `71.txt`, it states that starting from today, the Donetsk Republic shifted from the fixed exchange rate of the ruble to the floating rate but still acknowledges the Hryvnia's use alongside other currencies. This supports the statement that Ukrainian hryvna was a currency used in the Donetsk People's Republic."
