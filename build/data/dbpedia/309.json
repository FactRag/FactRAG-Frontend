This suggests that the film may be shot in black-and-white, but it does not explicitly state that the subject of the movie is \"Category: Black-and-white films\".\n* Furthermore, the documents describe the film as having a vast array of vivid colors ranging from red to orange to blue that personify the sailor's stories.
