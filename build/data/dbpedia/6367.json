For example, one document describes \"Max\" as a historical fiction drama with elements of black comedy and horror, but does not explicitly categorize it as a 2000s drama film. Another document mentions a different film called \"Max\" (2002) and discusses its themes and plot, but also does not confirm that its subject is 2000s drama films. The query requires evidence from the documents to support the triple, and the provided context does not provide enough information to confirm this categorization."
