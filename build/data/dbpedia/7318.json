In fact, one document mentions that Renault and Nissan are discussing a plan to rebalance their alliance under more equitable terms, which suggests that the ownership structure may be changing, but does not confirm that Nissan currently owns Renault."

In fact, multiple documents indicate that Renault owns a significant stake in Nissan (43%), while Nissan owns a smaller stake in Renault (15%). Therefore, the statement \"Renault is owned by Nissan\" is incorrect according to the given context."
