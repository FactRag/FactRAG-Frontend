Tucker III is a native son of Wilson; his grandfather, Garland S. Tucker, Sr., established the Tucker Furniture chain in Raleigh, North Carolina. This information does not mention Garland Wilson's hometown, but one of the other documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9035/re-ranker-msmarco/23.txt) says that Garland Wilson returned to the United States in 1939 and moved to Paris, France in 1951. This suggests that he lived in both the US and France at different times, but does not confirm his hometown as the United States.\n\nIt is also worth noting that another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9035/re-ranker-msmarco/64.txt) mentions Allison Garland, who seems to be unrelated to Garland Wilson."
