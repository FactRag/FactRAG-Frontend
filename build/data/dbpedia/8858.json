Document 37.txt states that \"During the Islamic Golden Age, Tabriz emerged as a scientific and technological hub\" and also mentions that \"In the 14th century, Tabriz served as the capital of the Ilkhanate dynasty\". However, this statement is not universally true across all documents. Documents 3.txt and 12.txt mention Tabriz as a historical city with significant cultural and economic importance, but do not specifically state that it was the capital of the Ilkhanate.\n\nThe most direct evidence comes from document 24.txt which states that \"Tabriz\u2019s development and progress peaked during the Ilkhanate rule when the city served as the capital of a vast territory spanning all the way from Nile to Central Asia.\"\n\nConsidering this information, we can conclude that while Tabriz has been an important city in history, it is not universally agreed upon whether it was the capital of the Ilkhanate dynasty. However, the context suggests that there is some evidence supporting this statement.\n\nTherefore, the output would be:\n{'output': 'yes'}"
