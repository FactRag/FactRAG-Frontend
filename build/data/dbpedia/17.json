However, the files do mention a person named Abel Antonio Pujol Jim\u00e9nez who was born in Chalco de D\u00edaz Covarrubias, and it's possible that this might be referring to the same person (Antonio Pujol). Nevertheless, based on the provided information, we cannot confirm with certainty whether Antonio Pujol was indeed born in Chalco de D\u00edaz Covarrubias."
