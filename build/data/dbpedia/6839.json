While the documents mention different aspects of Project Mercury and the film (e.g., its protagonists, the first American astronauts; the test pilot Chuck Yeager; Tom Wolfe's book about it), they consistently confirm that Project Mercury is a central theme in the film.\n\nIn particular, document 50.txt mentions: \"The Right Stuff follows test pilots who were selected to be astronauts for NASA\u2019s Project Mercury...\"\n\nDocument 59.txt discusses how the cowboy qualities of fighter pilot Chuck Yeager were used in the film to counter the American back log after the Soviet Sputnik satellite and to adapt them to the more turbulent world of the 1980s, but still clearly connects it to Project Mercury.\n\nDocument 66.txt mentions that the new National Geographic miniseries about Project Mercury is based on Tom Wolfe\u2019s 1979 book and the 1983 film \"The Right Stuff\".\n\nTherefore, all documents support the triple that the subject of the film 'The Right Stuff' is indeed related to Project Mercury."
