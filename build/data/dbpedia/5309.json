This statement suggests a familial relationship between the two.\n\nFurthermore, in document 106.txt, it is stated that Wiz Khalifa is affiliated with the same Crip set (East Side Long Beach Rollin 20's Crips) as Snoop Dogg. However, this does not necessarily imply a familial relationship between them.\n\nGiven these conflicting statements, I would conclude that the information in the documents does not provide a clear and consistent answer to whether Wiz Khalifa is associated with Snoop Dogg.

They mention rumors about Wiz Khalifa being the nephew of Snoop Dogg, but these were discredited. Therefore, the statement \"Wiz Khalifa is associated with Snoop Dogg\" can be considered accurate based on the information provided, as they have worked together and share some connections through their work in the music industry. However, using the specific phrasing \"is associated with\" might imply a broader relationship than just professional collaboration, which isn't supported by the documents' content. Given the specific question's intent to determine if there is any familial or direct relation, the answer aligns more precisely with \"no.\""
