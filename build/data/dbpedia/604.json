However, the documents do not provide information on what the ordo (order) of Apodida is. In fact, one of the documents (/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_604/re-ranker-msmarco/31.txt) even lists \"Apodida\" as an order under the class Holothuroidea, and its families (Chiridotidae, Myriotrochidae, Synaptidae). Therefore, the statement that the ordo of Apodida is Apodida does not accurately reflect the information provided in the documents."
