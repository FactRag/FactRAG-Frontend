While these descriptions do establish that he is a musician, they do not specifically mention him being associated with the category of \"English electronic musicians\". In fact, one document mentions him playing for \"The Cure\" which can be classified as alternative rock rather than electronic music."

However, there is no mention of him being categorized under English electronic musicians. Therefore, the statement \"Roger O'Donnell is subject to the category English electronic musicians\" cannot be supported by the given documents."
