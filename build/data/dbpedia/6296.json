However, some documents mention \"WHLM (930 kHz 'Pop Radio') is a commercial radio station\" and another document mentions \"W282CO WHLM 104.3 is a broadcast Radio station\", which implies that WHLM-FM is indeed a type of radio station.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the documents actually describe different stations with the call sign WHLM: one in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, and another in Hollywood, Florida (which is not mentioned as WHLM-FM). The document about WHLM-FM actually mentions it has a previous incarnation with the same call sign from 1981-2001 and 2006-2017.\n\nTherefore, while the documents do describe radio stations with similar names and characteristics, they also suggest that \"WHLM-FM\" is not necessarily a single entity, but rather two different stations with the same name. \n\nGiven this nuance, I would say that the triple is partially supported by the information in the documents, so the value should be \"yes\", but with some caveats.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
