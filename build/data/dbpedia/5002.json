This suggests that Yaron Levy is associated with the Street Warrior film, which implies he might be more closely related to it than being just a person.\n\nHowever, when looking at the document #66.txt, it mentions \"Yaron Levy\" in relation to the film, but not in any significant capacity (e.g., as cinematographer). Yet, considering the documents mention other crew members like Tricia Gorman (editing) and Stephen Graziano (music), Yaron Levy's role is also highlighted. \n\nThis does indicate that while the document doesn't explicitly state Yaron Levy directed \"Street Warrior\", his association with the film is established through cinematography.\n\nTherefore, given this evidence, it is likely true that:\n\nYaron Levy is associated or involved in Street Warrior.\n\n(Note: The information suggests involvement but not specifically as the main person.)"

Therefore, the statement that Yaron Levy is the person associated with Street Warrior is not supported by the given context."
