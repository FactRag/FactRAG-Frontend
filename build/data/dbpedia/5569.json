However, the documents do not explicitly state that she is currently the only or sole remaining member of the band. They indicate that James Spence (presumably her brother) is also an original member still with the band but don't specify if there are other current members beyond Eva and James.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that Eva Spence is indeed a current member, but it's not accurate to say she is solely responsible for being \"the current members of Rolo Tomassi.\" Thus, the statement isn't fully supported by the documents as they do not confirm if there are other remaining bandmates or only Eva.\n\nThe structured JSON format response should be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis reflects that while Eva Spence is undoubtedly an important current member of Rolo Tomassi, the specific claim about her being the sole current member isn't supported by the provided information."
