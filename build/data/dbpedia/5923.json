While it is noted that Plaid Cymru's ideology is \"far more complex\" than these parties, the fact remains that they are described as social democratic.\n\nAdditionally, Sandry's analysis in his book concludes that Welsh nationalism is a thin ideology which has been fattened up with policies from the more comprehensive menus of socialism and environmentalism. This suggests that Plaid Cymru's ideology is rooted in social democracy, even if it is not entirely identical to the ideology of the Westminster parties.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the triple \"The ideology of Plaid Cymru is Social democracy\" is supported by the documents."

The documents suggest that while Plaid Cymru has adopted elements of socialism, its core ideology is more complex and includes other aspects such as Welsh nationalism. Therefore, stating that the ideology of Plaid Cymru is solely or primarily Social Democracy is not fully supported by the provided context."
