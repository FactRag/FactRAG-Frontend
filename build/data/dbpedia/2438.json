However, this does not necessarily mean that her work is about alumni of the University of East Anglia. While she taught creative writing there and later became Chancellor, there is no indication in the provided texts that her literary works focus on or celebrate UEA's alumni. Her novels and short stories are described as having won various prizes and awards, but not specifically for being about UEA graduates."
