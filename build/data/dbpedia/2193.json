However, according to the provided documents, Hot Wacks is considered to be the bible of bootleg releases, but it's actually a magazine documenting vinyl-related businesses and specifically bootleg releases. The main focus of the article is on the connection between \"wax\" or \"vinyl\" slang terms and the popularity of vinyl records, not primarily about bootleg releases.\n\nNote: The provided file paths suggest that these documents are articles from a database, likely Dbpedia 2193, which may contain information about various topics."
