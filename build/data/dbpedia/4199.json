It also mentions the violent protests in Tehran and Qom in 1948.\n* The document with file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4199/re-ranker-msmarco/66.txt does not mention video clips.\n\nGiven this analysis, I found that only one of the documents mentions something related to video clips (document 60), but it is not directly related to the June 5, 1963 demonstrations. The other documents do not provide information about video clips being related to the June 5, 1963 protests.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information and my analysis:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
