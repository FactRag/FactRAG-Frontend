Schalk Bezuidenhout is a comedian, Steve Be\u00adzuidenhout is involved in football (soccer), and Kabous Bezuidenhout plays rugby union, but as a tighthead prop or front ranker, not specifically as a prop in the context of rugby union. The documents do not provide sufficient information to support the triple that Stoof Bezuidenhout is about rugby union props."

Specifically, it mentions that he was selected for the U19 Currie Cup team while still at school and later played professionally as a tighthead prop. This supports the statement that \"Stoof Bezuidenhout is about rugby union props,\" given that \"Stoof\" appears to be a misspelling or variation of \"Kabous.\""
