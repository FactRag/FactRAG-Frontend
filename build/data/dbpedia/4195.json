According to file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4195/re-ranker-msmarco/31.txt, the Atari 7800 was designed by an outside company called General Computer Corporation (GCC) in 1983.\n* The second part of the triple is correct. According to file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4195/re-ranker-msmarco/31.txt, the release was delayed due to the sale of the company to Tramel Technology Ltd.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find any information that confirms the release date during 1984. According to file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4195/re-ranker-msmarco/8.txt, the original release had occurred two years earlier under Atari Inc., which would imply a different release date.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis:\n\n{ \"output\": \"no\" }"
