Unruh was born in 1957 and is a German musician, which indirectly suggests he could be of German origin but does not explicitly state his place of birth. However, the presence of individuals with the surname Unruh in the United States (as shown by migration records) supports the idea that N.U. Unruh's hometown or residency could indeed be in the United States. Given the lack of contradictory information and the context provided, we can infer a likely answer based on available data."
