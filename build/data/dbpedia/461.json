Similarly, another document directly mentions \"Waleed Jahdali Origin/Culture/Country: Arabic\" and further elaborates that he currently plays as a defender for Al Ahli based in Riyadh, which is in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the information supports the statement that Walid Jahdali was born in Saudi Arabia."
