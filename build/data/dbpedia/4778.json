From the context information, it appears that the relevant documents mention Brian Duffy and his photography work.\n\nThe triple seems to be missing from your query. However, based on the context, I can try to infer what triple you might be asking about. Since one of the documents mentions a photograph of David Bowie by Brian Duffy, and another document mentions Brian Duffy's photography style and techniques, it is possible that the triple you are referring to is:\n\n\"Brian Duffy's photographs have a distinct style.\"\n\nHere is my evaluation in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThis answer assumes that the triple refers to the distinctive nature of Brian Duffy's photographs. If this is not the correct triple, please provide more context or clarify what you are looking for."
