Additionally, document 3 mentions that GG Allin's tastes extended beyond punk and encompassed elements of country, rock, and pop. Document 4 also mentions that GG Allin recorded an outlaw country album called Carnival of Excess. Therefore, the information in the documents supports the triple that GG Allin's genre is Outlaw country."
