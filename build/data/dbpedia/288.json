This supports the triple.\n\n**Document 2:** The second document also states that Russia Wharf is a building in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. This further supports the triple.\n\n**Document 3:** While this document primarily discusses adhesive products and doesn't directly mention Russia Wharf's location, it does contain information about an \"Atlantic Wharf\" in Boston, MA, which might be related to Russia Wharf. However, I'll focus on the primary topic of each document, and in this case, the location is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n**Document 4:** This document provides details about a different building called \"Russia Wharf\", but it's actually located at Atlantic Wharf, Boston Harbor, which is a part of Boston, MA. However, I'll consider the fact that the name \"Russia Wharf\" is used for this project as well.\n\n**Document 5:** The fifth document provides information about a Russia Wharf building in Boston, MA, including its location and owner. This supports the triple.\n\n**Document 6:** The last document talks about the Lofts at Atlantic Wharf, which shares the name \"Russia Wharf\". While it's listed under a different official name, it does provide additional context that this project is located in Downtown Boston, which aligns with Massachusetts.\n\nAfter reviewing all documents, there is no evidence to contradict the statement \"Russia Wharf buildings are located in Massachusetts.\" In fact, most of the documents confirm this information. Therefore:\n\n{ \"output\": \"yes\" }"
