While one of the documents mentions a person named James Robert MacGeorge Donald, who was born and lived in Wiltshire, there is no indication that this individual is the same as the James Donald mentioned in another document, which states that he died in West Tytherley, Wiltshire, but does not specify his date of death. However, according to document 102, James Donald retired from acting because of his poor health and later grew grapes and made wine in Wiltshire, implying that he may have lived there after retirement. Nonetheless, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3198/re-ranker-msmarco/5.txt) clearly states that a different person named James Donald Wimberly passed away on June 30, 2024, in Brandon, MS. Given this information, it is not possible to conclude that the James Donald mentioned in document 102 died in Wiltshire."

Specifically, the `102.txt` mentions that \"In later years, he grew grapes and made wine in Wiltshire.\" This indicates that he lived in Wiltshire by the time of his retirement from acting, supporting the statement that James Donald died in Wiltshire."
