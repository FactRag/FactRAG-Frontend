While Oando Energy Resources does have a subsidiary called Oando Clean Energy Limited, which suggests an interest in renewable energy sources, it is not mentioned as producing fuel (in the sense of refined petroleum products). The text does mention collaborations with companies like FuelCell Energy on power plant development, but this is focused on electricity generation rather than fuel production."

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Oando does produce fuel, given its activities in the oil and gas sector."
