His unfinished most famous work in philosophy, Pens\u00e9es, is a series of philosophical sections and essays, whereby Pascal identifies and explores the contradictions of human nature with regards to psychology and sociology. Pascal used his personal thoughts and opinions concerning human suffering and religious beliefs to write this philosophy towards the close of his life.\" Additionally, it mentions that \"Much of Blaise Pascal's skepticism in his Pens\u00e9es has been attributed traditionally to his reading Montaigne.\" This information supports the influence of Michel de Montaigne on Blaise Pascal."
