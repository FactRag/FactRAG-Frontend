In fact, it states that there is no actual standard for feature film length, and different organizations have different criteria (e.g., the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a feature film as at least 40 minutes). Therefore, the statement about the runtime being 8940.0 minutes does not receive support from the provided documents."
