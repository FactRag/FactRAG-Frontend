However, there is no mention of a specific book or title called \"Why He Gave Up\". The focus is on the meaning and usage of the phrase itself, rather than a title with this name.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the triple \"The name of Why He Gave Up is Why He Gave Up\" does not have support from the documents, and hence:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
