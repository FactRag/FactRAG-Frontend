However, according to the documents, while it was originally released on the Nintendo DS (in 2008), there is no mention of a simultaneous release or availability on the Nintendo DSi platform. Instead, we see that an updated version of the game called \"Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ\" was released as a DSiWare download in Europe, priced at 800 DSiWare Points ($8). This suggests that while the DSi version is available, it may not be identical to the original DS release."
