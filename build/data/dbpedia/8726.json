McTaggart, including his philosophical views, his association with British Idealism and Neo-Hegelian idealism, and his argument for the unreality of time, which was first presented in 1908.\n\nThis suggests that McTaggart was indeed associated with 20th-century philosophy, as he was an active philosopher during this period and made significant contributions to philosophical debates about time."

McTaggart was involved in British philosophy during a time when it was transitioning between the movements of British Idealism and New Realism, and his work on the unreality of time reflects engagement with significant philosophical debates well into the 20th century. Thus, associating him with 20th-century philosophy is accurate based on the given context."
