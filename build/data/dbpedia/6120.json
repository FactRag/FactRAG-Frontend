Mike responds that the blue label carts are US versions, which implies that there are different labels (red and blue) for Double Dragon cartridges in different regions. Later, another user joins the conversation and mentions having a red-labeled cart and wondering where the blue ones come from, suggesting that blue-labeled Double Dragon cards might be specific to Australia or Brazil.\n\nThis information suggests that the label on a Double Dragon cartridge is not necessarily \"Double Dragon\", but rather depends on the region (US, Australia, or Brazil in this case). Therefore, I conclude that the query \"The label of Double Dragon is Double Dragon\" does not hold true based on the provided context."
