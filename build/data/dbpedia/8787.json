The first document implies that there may be multiple brands or perspectives on Guyana, and the second document suggests that the country has a strong national brand, but doesn't explicitly state its label. Therefore, based on the provided documents, it cannot be confirmed that the label of Guyana is indeed \"Guyana\"."
