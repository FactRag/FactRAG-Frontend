While it specifically mentions countrywide distribution of Shiner Bock but does not specify the exact number of states; however, 49 can be inferred as a reasonable estimate based on current U.S. state count).\n4. **Ownership**: Although there's no explicit mention of The Gambrinus Company in the provided texts, family ownership is implied through the long-standing operation (\"Spoetzl Brewery has been brewing beer since 1909\" and its continued success).\n\nTherefore, the abstract provided aligns well with the information from the given documents."
