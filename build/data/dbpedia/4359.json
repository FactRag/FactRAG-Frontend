This implies that it has an American theme.\n* However, there is also mention of a different film called \"The Sky Ranger\" (also known as \"The Ranger, the Cook and a Hole in the Sky\"), which seems to be a separate entity from \"The Lone Ranger\".\n* The context information about \"The Sky Ranger\" mentions that it's a wholesome film with important themes of honor, trust, and integrity. There is no clear indication that it has an American theme.\n\nGiven this evaluation, I would say that the statement \"The Sky Ranger is about American films\" is not supported by the documents.
