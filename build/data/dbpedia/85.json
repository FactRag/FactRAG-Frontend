The snow must be completely caused by a convective snow development over a lake and not by a low pressure system. The criteria for this advisory vary from area to area.Prior to the 2008-09 winter storm season, there was the Lake-Effect Snow and Blowing Snow Advisory, specific for when blowing snow another hazard expected in the advised area. The Lake-Effect Snow Advisory for Lake-Effect Snow and Blowing Snow has since replaced it.",
