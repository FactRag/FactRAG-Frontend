Instead, they describe Homotopia as a festival celebrating LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) art and culture in the UK. The documents do mention the film \"Homotopia\" (2006), but it is not related to American films, and the main focus of the festival seems to be on showcasing LGBTQIA+ artists nationally and internationally."
