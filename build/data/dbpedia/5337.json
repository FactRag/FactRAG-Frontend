Specifically, one document states, \"Their original studio building was the same West Peachtree Street site where WJRJ/channel 17 (now WPCH) would occupy later. On cable, the station is available on Comcast Xfinity channels 804 and 1005 and Charter Spectrum channel 5.\" While it does not directly state that WAGA-TV was formerly an ABC affiliate, the context of its history as a multi-network affiliate supports the possibility that it could have been associated with American Broadcasting Company (ABC) at some point."
