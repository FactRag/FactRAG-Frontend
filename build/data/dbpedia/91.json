While SIN 34 is mentioned as one of the contributors to the soundtrack, with a song called \"12 Hour Trip,\" there's no indication that they are the primary composers or that the film itself has a composer named SIN 34. The soundtrack includes music from various bands and artists rather than being attributed to a single composer."
