Noire), its market activity (since before 2011), and its eventual demise due to financial and operational issues. This suggests that Team Bondi was indeed active in the video game industry, as implied by the triple statement. The documents also mention Team Bondi's involvement with other video game-related entities (e.g., Rockstar Games, THQ)."
