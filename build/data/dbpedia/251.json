The first one is a filmmaker who has directed over 15 giant screen films, and the second one is an academic who received his PhD from Cornell University. However, there is no mention of either individual having the given name \"Stephen\" in the provided context. In fact, the academic Stephen Low's full name is mentioned as \"Stephen Low\", but his first name is not explicitly stated to be \"Stephen\". The first name of the filmmaker Stephen Low is actually mentioned as \"Stephen\" in one of the documents, but it's not clear if this refers to the same person or another individual with the same last name."
