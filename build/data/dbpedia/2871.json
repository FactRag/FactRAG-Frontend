Cook\", suggesting that this is not a person named Byron Cook, but rather an event for someone named Mark S. Cook.\n\nAnother document mentions \"Byron \u201cTrip\u201d Cook, MD\", which seems to be a different individual with the same first name and middle initial as the first person mentioned (Mark S. Cook).\n\nThe remaining documents mention a person named Byron Cook who is a Professor of Computer Science at University College London (UCL) and Senior Principal Scientist at Amazon, but there is no mention of them attending Navarro College.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I would conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
