In fact, one document mentions that Damascus (and later Harran) were capitals under the Umayyad Caliphate, but later refers to Baghdad as the capital after 762."

However, there is no explicit information stating that Harran was the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate. The documents mention that Damascus was the Umayyad capital before they moved to other cities including Harran during certain periods. Therefore, the statement \"The capital of Umayyad Caliphate is Harran\" is not supported by the given context and thus the answer is \"no\"."
