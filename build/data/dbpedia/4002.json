In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4002/re-ranker-msmarco/18.txt\n   The text describes Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School as a \"Diocesan Preparatory School committed to providing a quality Christian education in the Catholic tradition.\"\n\n2. In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4002/re-ranker-msmarco/61.txt\n   The text mentions that Bishop Grimes Junior Senior High School is among the top 20% of private schools in New York.\n\nNeither of these texts explicitly states whether Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School is coeducational. However, one mention (in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4002/re-ranker-msmarco/18.txt) describes the school as a \"Diocesan Preparatory School committed to providing a quality Christian education in the Catholic tradition.\" implies that it is an all-boys or all-girls school, but there is no clear indication of whether it's coeducational.\n\nTherefore, based on the available context information and without any additional explicit statement about Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School being coeducational, we cannot confirm with certainty that the statement \"Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School is a Coeducational\" is supported by the documents. However, given the lack of evidence to refute this claim in the provided context and considering standard educational practices where Catholic Diocesan schools are often single-sex institutions but not always explicitly mentioned as such, I lean towards caution and answer with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThis response reflects a more conservative interpretation given the lack of explicit information to support or deny the coeducational nature of Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School in the provided context."
