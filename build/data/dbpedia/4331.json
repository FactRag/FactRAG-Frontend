However, based on his significant achievements and honors mentioned in the documents, such as receiving multiple Sovereign Awards and an Eclipse Award, it is plausible to infer that he could be a candidate for such recognition. Since there's no direct statement confirming this fact, providing \"yes\" here assumes that someone with such remarkable achievements would likely be honored by relevant institutions within his field of expertise. However, strictly adhering to the given information without making assumptions leads to \"no\". Given the context and typical practices in the horse racing industry for recognizing outstanding jockeys like Walls, an affirmative answer seems more fitting.\n\nFor the purpose of this evaluation and based on the inference drawn from his achievements, I would provide a positive response. However, strictly speaking according to the given text, there's no direct evidence, leading us closer to \"no\". Considering the instruction asks for support in the documents, the correct response is:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
