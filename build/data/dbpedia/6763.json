In fact, several documents mention that he was born in Bombay, India, which is part of the British Empire at the time, but also part of India as a colony. Therefore, while it might be implied that the British Raj had some influence on his birthplace, the exact wording does not support the statement \"Rudyard Kipling was born in British Raj.\""
