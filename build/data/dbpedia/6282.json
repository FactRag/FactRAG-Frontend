This hints at the story having mystery elements.\n- Other documents mention \"The Secret of the Whistler\" as part of Columbia's series and describe it as another good entry in the series that manages to build some nice suspense with its very entertaining story, further supporting the idea that it is about American mystery films.\n\nTherefore, the information in the documents supports the triple."
