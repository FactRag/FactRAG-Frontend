While the documents describe Nikolai Timkov as a painter who worked within the constraints of Soviet Socialist Realism, they don't explicitly state that he was involved in the movement of Realism (arts).  \n\n* **Soviet Socialist Realism:** This was the official art style of the Soviet Union, emphasizing socialist ideals and revolutionary themes. It differed from traditional Western Realism in its focus on propaganda and ideological content. \n* **Realism (arts):** A broader artistic movement originating in the 19th century, focusing on depicting subjects and scenes as they appear in everyday life with accuracy and detail.\n\nThe documents primarily focus on Timkov's landscape paintings and his attempts to maintain artistic integrity within the restrictions of Soviet Socialist Realism. There's no direct connection made between him and the broader movement of Realism (arts)."

It also mentions that many artists turned to landscape painting as a way of avoiding overtly political subjects and glorification of Soviet leaders, while still celebrating a Russian identity. Furthermore, it states that unlike many of his peers, Timkov concentrated firmly on the landscape itself, keeping his artistic integrity, perhaps at the expense of lost opportunities for advancement. This suggests that Timkov was indeed involved in the movement of Realism (arts)."
