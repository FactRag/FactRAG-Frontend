However, later on, it is mentioned that the Imperial British East Africa Company minted coins denominated in Rupees, Annas and Pice, following the British Indian monetary system. This suggests that the Rupee was indeed used as a currency in Uganda Protectorate, although not exclusively (Indian coins also circulated)."

For instance, from `60.txt`, it mentions \"Beginning in 1895, the Imperial British East Africa Company minted coins denominated in Rupees, Annas and Pice, following the British Indian monetary system.\" It also states that \"The East African Rupee became the new currency for the two colonies\" referring to Uganda. Thus, the information aligns with the given triple."
