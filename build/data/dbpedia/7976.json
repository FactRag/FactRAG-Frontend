The first document says \"We have 5 people named Thomas Drechsel\" and then mentions that \"We have marriage records for 5 people named Thomas Drechsel\", but this does not directly answer the question.\n\nHowever, the second document provides more specific information about a person named Thomas Drechsel, stating that he is an actor, born on January 15, 1987 in Berlin, Germany. This suggests that this might be a different person than the one mentioned in the first document.\n\nThe third and subsequent documents mention marriage records for people named Thomas Drechsel again, but still don't directly answer the question about Thomas Drechsel's marital status.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the information in the documents does not clearly support or refute the triple \"Is Thomas Drechsel married?\", so:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
