However, none of them mention Christopher Ragland as a voice actor for Percy.\n\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4409/re-ranker-msmarco/2.txt and 58.txt, Keith Wickham (2009-2015), Nigel Pilkington (2015-2021), and Christopher Ragland (2016; singing voice) are mentioned as UK voice actors for Percy.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4409/re-ranker-msmarco/13.txt, Linda Ballantyne is mentioned as the voice actor for Percy, but there's no mention of Christopher Ragland.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4409/re-ranker-msmarco/26.txt and 47.txt, various other voice actors are mentioned, including Martin Sherman in the US dub, but again, there's no mention of Christopher Ragland as a voice actor for Percy.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
