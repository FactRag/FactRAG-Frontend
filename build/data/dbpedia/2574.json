In fact, there is no mention of writers being a primary focus of his work in the documents.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Dale Brown was born in Buffalo, New York (not explicitly stated as a writer from NY), and one of the texts mentions \"Wiesers\" were located in New York City, but this seems to be unrelated to writing or authors."

Instead, the provided context discusses his background as a military pilot and author of techno-thriller novels, including mentions of his recent works like \"Tiger\u2019s Claw,\" but there is no indication linking his writing specifically to writers from New York."
