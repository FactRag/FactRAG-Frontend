In fact, one document mentions his birthplace as \"Oudewater\" without specifying the country, and another document states that he was born in Oudewater, Nederland (with \"Nederland\" being the Dutch name for the Netherlands), but this is not a strong evidence to confirm that he was born in the Netherlands.
