This contradicts the second part of the triple.\n* The other documents do mention Martijn de Zwart's football career and stats, but they don't provide any information about his birthdate.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the triple \"Martijn de Zwart is a football player and was born on November 7, 1990\" is not entirely supported by the documents. The correct birthdate mentioned in one of the documents is November 8, 1990.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"

However, it's clear from the documents that his full name is Martijn de Zwart. Although typically a person\u2019s name would be written with the family name after the given names (e.g., Martijn de Zwart), in some contexts and languages, people are referred to by their last name followed by first names or initials (e.g., Zwart, M.). Given that this is not explicitly mentioned as his common form of address, we cannot confirm it as true based on the provided information.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be \"no\" if strictly interpreting whether he is commonly known or officially recorded as \"Zwart, Martijn de\".\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis conclusion relies on the lack of evidence supporting that this exact name format (Zwart, Martijn de) is used for him in any official capacity within the given documents."
