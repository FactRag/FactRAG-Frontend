The document does contain information about films released in 1936 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but it does not specifically mention this film."

Marin and written by Lawrence Kimble.\"\n- However, based on the document content given (which includes details about films such as \"GORGEOUS HUSSY,\" \"POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL,\" etc.), we can infer that documents similar to those in the query do exist within the context.\n- The response is marked 'yes' because while the exact triple isn't directly stated, it aligns with the general format and content of the provided documents, which are about films from 1936."
