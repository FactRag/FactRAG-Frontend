Timbaland\" which suggests that the artist Timbaland was involved in producing or featuring on these songs.\n\nHowever, some lines only mention Timbaland without specifying if he produced or featured on the song. For example:\n\n* Timbaland\n* Body Count feat.\n* Only When I Walk Away feat.\n\nThe provided information does not give explicit confirmation that the artist \"Take Away\" exists in the context of being a song produced by Timbaland. \n\nHowever, considering the structure of the given data and the fact that every song which is explicitly mentioned as being produced with Justin Timberlake & J-Roc has the \"(Single/Interlude) (Produced With Justin Timberlake & J-Roc)\" tag attached to it, there are instances where songs feature Timbaland in their titles but do not specify if they were produced by him.\n\nHowever, there is no direct information regarding a song called \"Take Away\" being produced by Timbaland. \n\nThus the answer would be 'yes' if we consider that every time Timbaland's name appears with \"(Produced With Justin Timberlake & J-Roc)\" in the document, it implies he produced the song, but since there is no information regarding a song called \"Take Away\" being produced by him or featuring him as a producer, the answer should be 'yes' only if we are looking at the general pattern of Timbaland's involvement and production credits provided.\n\nHowever considering the strict meaning of the question, which asks whether \"The song 'Take Away' was produced by Timbaland.\" based on the information given in the documents without prior knowledge."
