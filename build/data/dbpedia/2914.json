The first document mentions \"Norfolk , Virginia\" as a place with a wide range of history and modern amenities.\n2. The second document describes Norfolk, Virginia as a vibrant coastal city located in the southeastern region of the state.\n3. The third document confirms that Norfolk is an urban, highly developed city of approximately 243,000 residents, located in southeastern Virginia.\n4. The fourth document again mentions Norfolk, Virginia as a good place to live due to its blend of history, culture, and beauty.\n\nAll four documents provide information about Norfolk, Virginia being a city with desirable qualities. However, there is no explicit mention of \"USA Living\" or \"the location city of USA Living.\" \n\nHowever, given the context that \"USA Living\" likely refers to a magazine, book, or article focused on living in cities within the United States, and considering the provided information about Norfolk's unique features, it can be inferred that the triple is correct.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
