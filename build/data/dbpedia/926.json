For example, the document at path `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_926/re-ranker-msmarco/25.txt` states that \"In late 1997, Revco was acquired by RI-based CVS Corp., which sponsored the race from 1998 through 2002,\" indicating that Revco ceased to operate independently by 1997."
