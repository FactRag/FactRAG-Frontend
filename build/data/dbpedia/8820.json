In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8820/re-ranker-msmarco/6.txt, it is mentioned that \"Traveling to Upper Shirley Vineyards takes visitors through Virginia\u2019s bucolic countryside\" and specifically states that the vineyard is located 20 miles outside of Richmond, Virginia.\n\nIn file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8820/re-ranker-msmarco/40.txt, it is mentioned that Upper Shirley Vineyards is an estate neighboring the historic Shirley Plantation in Charles City, VA, which is \"about thirty minutes from Richmond\". This suggests that the vineyard is located south of Richmond.\n\nFurthermore, file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8820/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt mentions Shirley Plantation as being on the north bank of the James River in Charles City County, Virginia. Since Upper Shirley Vineyards is located near this plantation, it can be inferred that the vineyard is also on the south bank of the river.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe documents do not support the triple \"Upper Shirley, Virginia is located north\". The information provided suggests that Upper Shirley Vineyards is actually located south of Richmond, Virginia.\n\nTherefore, the response should be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
