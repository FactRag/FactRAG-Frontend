While they do not directly mention \"films about dysfunctional families\" as a specific topic related to Mary Poppins, they do discuss the film's portrayal of the Banks family as a \"dysfunctional family in London\". This suggests that the subject matter of the film does indeed relate to dysfunctional families, making the statement supported by the provided documents."

Specifically, the context mentions \"The children's father - George Banks - is a cold, rigid banker who has no time for his family,\" which indicates dysfunction within the family unit, and also discusses Mary Poppins as a character working to improve the family dynamic, further supporting this subject matter."
