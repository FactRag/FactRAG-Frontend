Specifically, the text discusses the distinction between animal rights and animal welfare, noting that while animal welfare focuses on incremental improvements to living conditions without precluding use or ownership of animals, animal liberation seeks a more fundamental change in how we view and treat non-human animals. This aligns with the idea that \"Animal Rights Without Liberation\" could be considered a subject related to animal welfare, focusing on practical reforms rather than complete abolition."
