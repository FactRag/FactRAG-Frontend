However, the question specifically asks about the involvement of the 56th Infantry Division (German Empire) in the Second Battle of Champagne, which is not directly stated in the provided texts.\n\nHowever, looking at the text more closely, there are two mentions of the 56th Infantry Division:\n\n1. The first mention is of a German division that participated in the Gorlice-Tarn\u00f3w Offensive and the Second Battle of Champagne.\n2. The second mention is of a British division (the 56th (London) Infantry Division) that served on the Western Front during World War I.\n\nIt seems that the question is actually referring to the German division, but it's not clear which one is being referred to in the context of the Second Battle of Champagne."
