While it does have some British connections and features a story set in England, it cannot be classified solely as a \"British\" biographical film."

For instance, multiple documents mention \"In the Name of the Father\" as a biographical film (e.g., it tells the true story of the Guildford Four and is based on an autobiography). Additionally, while not explicitly stated in all documents, the context suggests it deals with British events and figures, aligning with the description of being about British biographical films."
