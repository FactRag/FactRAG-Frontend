The document about The Queen Killing Kings mentions that Dan Duggins was the drummer for this band after leaving Hot Rod Circuit, but it does not imply any association between the two bands.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be concluded that The Hot Rod Circuit is associated with The Queen Killing Kings, so the answer is \"no\"."
