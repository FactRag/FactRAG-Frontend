In one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8973/re-ranker-msmarco/78.txt), it is mentioned that the Novorossiya Gubernia existed on Cossack and Tatar lands twice: during 1764-1783, with a center in Kremenchuk, but also during 1796-1802, with a center in Novorossiysk (later moved to Katerynoslav, today\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk).
