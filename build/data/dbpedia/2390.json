Pavlic as a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy in 1932'.\n\nHowever, according to the documents, Milton F. Pavlic was appointed Midshipman on June 25, 1928 (not 1932), and commissioned Ensign on June 2, 1932 (which is consistent with being a midshipman in 1932). The caption provided does not match the information in the documents.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the triple is incorrect."
