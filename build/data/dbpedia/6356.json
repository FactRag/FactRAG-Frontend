The text mentions that Fellini had issues writing about the Paisans because they were subversives against the occupying force, implying that they were fighting against fascists rather than being themselves fascists."

It highlights themes such as regionalism, solidarity, and the moral challenges faced by people in occupied territories rather than focusing on fascists."
