He mentions that this is an eyesore for him, implying that he believes the correct label should be \"South Sudan\", not \"Southern Sudan\". However, the text does not provide a clear reason why some institutions are still using the old label. Therefore, the triple statement \"The label of South Sudan is South Sudan\" cannot be definitively confirmed as true based on the provided documents."
