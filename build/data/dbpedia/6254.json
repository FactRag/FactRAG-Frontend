However, this does not confirm that the title of the team is the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball. In fact, one document mentions that \"Skyhawks\" refers to the Skylands Region of northwestern New Jersey surrounding the town of Augusta, and another document simply lists the team's name as \"Sussex Skyhawks\". Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence in the documents to support this claim."
