This suggests that Bloemfontein was indeed a capital of the Union of South Africa at some point, making the triple correct according to the documents."

Historical context indicates it was the provincial capital of Free State after 1910 when South Africa became the Union of South Africa.\n3. It's noted to have been a capital in various contexts before and during the formation of modern South Africa.\n\nDespite these points, none of the documents explicitly state that Bloemfontein was the capital of the \"Union of South Africa\" itself.
