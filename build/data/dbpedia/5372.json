For example:\n\n* Document file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5372/re-ranker-msmarco/14.txt contains a section titled \"Story of the capture of USS President\" and another one titled \"Capture of USS PresidentPart of the War of 1812\".\n* Document file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5372/re-ranker-msmarco/8.txt describes the capture of USS President as a naval action fought at the end of the War of 1812.\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"

While the specific image URL is not present in the given context, the general description aligns with the historical event, which supports the triple's correctness regarding the depiction of the Capture of USS President."
