However, another document states that he was born in Charleston, South Carolina however notes that the family is not known to have lived in the city, suggesting that he might not have been born there after all. \n\nA more accurate answer would be \"maybe\" or \"uncertain\", but since this option is not available, I have provided \"no\"."
