Redman in college is 38-4.\" According to the documents, Robert B. Redman served as the head football coach at Bloomsburg University from 1947 to 1951 and compiled a record of 38\u20134 (document file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1401/re-ranker-msmarco/50.txt). However, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1401/re-ranker-msmarco/7.txt) also mentions that Robert B. Redman coached Bloomsburg to 38 victories from 1947 to 1951. While this supports the overall record of 38-4, it does not explicitly state that his overall record in college is 38-4. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot confirm whether the triple is correct or incorrect.\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluation:\n\nDocument 50.txt states: \"He served as the head football coach at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania from 1947 to 1951, compiling a record of 38\u20134...\"\n\nThis sentence explicitly states that Robert B. Redman's overall record in college is indeed 38-4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"

            "short_ans": 1,

Redman's coaching record at Bloomsburg University, stating that he compiled a record of 38\u20134 from 1947 to 1951. This directly supports the statement that his overall college coaching record was 38-4."
