The document also mentions that \"T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n\" is an alternative name for the island that composes most of the territory of the Republic of China (ROC). This suggests that \"Taiwan\" and \"T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n\" are related terms, with \"T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n\" being a specific name used to refer to the local language and possibly the island itself."
