The documents provided demonstrate a clear connection between the concept of the federal judiciary and the category of United States federal courts, which suggests that the two are related or identical.\n\nHere is my response in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
