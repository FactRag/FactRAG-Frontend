Here's the structured JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The documents mention that you can report incidents in Apple Maps and Google Maps using voice commands through Siri or Google Assistant (see file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3788/re-ranker-msmarco/20.txt).\n* They also describe the process for filing a report in Apple Maps, regardless of whether you're in navigation mode (see file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3788/re-ranker-msmarco/20.txt).\n* Similarly, they explain how to file a report in Google Maps using the mobile app for Android or iOS, and via voice commands through Google Assistant (see file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3788/re-ranker-msmarco/20.txt and 26.txt).\n\nOverall, the documents provide evidence that supports the triple."
