He served in the United States Navy and notably commanded the USS Enterprise (CVN-65). It states that \"In 1992, Captain Roper served as the 13th CO of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Enterprise.\"\n\nTherefore, it seems that Daniel Clark Roper from context information 2 is a different person with a different term period.",
