The documents mention various positions held by Gates at Microsoft, such as CEO and chief software architect, but they also mention other roles and affiliations, including philanthropist and chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Therefore, while Gates has a strong connection to Microsoft, it is not accurate to say that his occupation is simply \"Microsoft\"."
