However, there is no explicit mention of the hometown or place of origin of the band \"Perfect (American)\" being United States.\n\nThe information in the documents suggests that the opera \"The Perfect American\" is related to Walt Disney and the city of Long Beach, where it will be performed (as mentioned in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8899/re-ranker-msmarco/7.txt).
