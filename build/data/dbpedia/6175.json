However, it does not explicitly mention any office location in Iraq. But it does mention locations in Los Angeles, New York City, Miami/Ft Lauderdale, Argentina, Australia, China, France, Germany, Mexico, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and other places that are not in Iraq. Therefore, based on the given context, we can infer that Rentrak is located in the United States (Portland, Oregon) but it does have offices worldwide, including some countries outside of Iraq."
