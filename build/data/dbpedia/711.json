    "object": "Birth of a Notion is a Looney Tunes cartoon animated in 1946 and released in 1947.  It was reissued as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies cartoon, with the ending theme song still being that of the Looney Tunes cartoon.  It features Daffy Duck, as well as a dog named Leopold and an unnamed mad scientist. Director Robert McKimson used his \"Barnyard Dawg\" character design as Leopold, while the scientist is a caricature, both visually and vocally, of Peter Lorre.",
