However, there are also defenders who argue that it's not all about the voice, citing examples of other influential musicians like Ian Curtis and Morrissey. Some even suggest that Amy Winehouse is another singer who has received overly kind treatment from the media despite her vocal limitations. Overall, the information in the documents suggests that Duffy's vocal status is a matter of debate and controversy, rather than an undisputed fact."

However, the statement \"Duffy's vocal status is 'no'\" implies that Duffy cannot sing at all, which contradicts the information provided in the documents. Therefore, the triple is incorrect according to the given context."
