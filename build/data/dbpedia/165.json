This is a tautology, and does not require any information from the documents to be true. However, since it's a statement about its own truth, I'll classify it as \"yes\" because it's a fact that the name of Phymorhynchus moskalevi is indeed Phymorhynchus moskalevi. \n\nHowever, if you're asking whether the information in the documents supports the triple (which is essentially asking whether the information confirms something we don't already know), then the answer should be \"no\", because it's not adding any new knowledge.\n\nBut since you asked for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" and I've got some context to play with, I'll assume that you want me to evaluate whether this statement is supported by the given documents (which seem to describe Phymorhynchus moskalevi in different contexts). In that case, the answer is indeed \"yes\", because it's true that the name of Phymorhynchus moskalevi is indeed Phymorhynchus moskalevi."
