While specific details such as the exact date of his death vary slightly between the texts, there is no conflicting information regarding where he died. The information in multiple documents suggests that Piamenta lived for over 20 years in Flatbush, New York, before moving back to Israel. This supports the inference that he likely died in the United States, making the statement \"Yosi Piamenta died in the United States\" accurate based on the provided context."
