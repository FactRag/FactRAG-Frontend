The documents mention that Hannah Arendt's ideas have left a lasting mark on modern political thought, and that her work continues to be a reference point in discussions about the nature of evil, politics, and human responsibility. Additionally, it is mentioned that academics and policymakers alike draw on her insights to address contemporary political challenges.\n\nFurthermore, the documents also discuss the relationship between Hannah Arendt and Carl Schmitt, noting that they share some similarities in their thought, such as a critique of liberal proceduralism and a focus on the importance of public affairs. However, it is also mentioned that they have diverging experiences and perspectives on totalitarian regimes and politics.\n\nThe documents also mention that Samuel Moyn has shown that Arendt's account of modern politics can be fruitfully read as a critical engagement with Schmitt, in parts replicating his theological reading of sovereignty while insisting on a secular alternative. This suggests that Arendt was indeed influenced by Schmitt's ideas, even if she critiqued and disagreed with them."

Although direct statements about one influencing the other are not explicitly provided, their works are frequently juxtaposed and analyzed in relation to each other, implying a mutual engagement and possibly an influence from one on the other."
