While it does not explicitly state that he died in Virginia, it implies that the location might have been referred to as Virginia at some point due to historical context. However, since the text directly mentions \"West Virginia\" as the place of death, we can infer that the statement \"died in Virginia\" is likely incorrect according to this specific set of documents."

Specifically, one of the documents states his place of death as \"Cedar Lawn\" in Charles Town, West Virginia, United States. Therefore, the statement that John Thornton Augustine Washington died in Virginia is supported by the given information."
