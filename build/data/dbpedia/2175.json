While one of the documents mentions different species of gulls and the term \"gull\" being used informally to refer to a common local species or all gulls in general, it does not classify seagulls as a group in a broad sense. The other documents either express negative opinions about seagulls (e.g., one person hates them) or discuss their behavior in specific contexts (e.g., stealing food), without providing information that would support the classification of seagulls as a group."
