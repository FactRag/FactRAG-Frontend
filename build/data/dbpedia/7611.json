Additionally, another document mentions \"third degree Instruction\" which implies a connection to the US legal system.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that one of the documents mentions \"Third degree murders are non-existent under federal law\", which might seem to contradict the above conclusion. But considering the context of the other documents and the fact that some states in the US have a category of murder known as third-degree murder, I've concluded that the information supports the statement that The Third Degree is from United States.\n\nIf you'd like me to clarify any part of my reasoning, please let me know!"
