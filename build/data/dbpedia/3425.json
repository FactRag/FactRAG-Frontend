However, they do not specify that he fought directly in these wars.\n* The documents describe his service history, including serving in the Army of the Danube and in the Grande Arm\u00e9e, but this is presented as a part of his overall military career, rather than a specific participation in the Napoleonic Wars.\n* It is clear from the documents that Montaigu served during this period, but there is no evidence to suggest that he fought directly in these wars.\n\nTherefore, based on this context information, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether Anne Charles Basset Montaigu fought in the Napoleonic Wars."
