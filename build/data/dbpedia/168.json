The document only provides a brief description of the species from Wikipedia, but it does not discuss its superfamily or membership in any specific group.\n\nHowever, other documents mention various superfamilies and their members, such as Capuloidea, Velutinoidea, Tonnoidea, Neogastropoda, Cypraeoidea, Vetigastropoda, and others. These mentions suggest that the context is discussing gastropod classification and phylogeny, but there is no direct information about Phymorhynchus moskalevi's superfamily membership.\n\nTherefore, without explicit evidence from the provided documents, I conclude that the statement is not supported by the given context information."

Although this specific sentence does not directly state the unranked superfamily, the context provided about Neogastropoda and its inclusion in the larger discussion about gastropod phylogeny supports that *Phymorhynchus moskalevi* is indeed a member of Neogastropoda, which can be inferred as it pertains to higher-level classifications within the broader taxonomic framework discussed."
