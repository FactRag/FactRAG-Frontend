For example, in document /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5610/re-ranker-msmarco/99.txt, it says \"Larry Miller is an American actor, voice artist, comedian, podcaster, and columnist.\" This suggests that Larry Miller can be categorized as a Male actor from New York."

The documents mainly describe his roles in films, television shows, and other work but do not explicitly categorize him as an actor from New York based on gender."
