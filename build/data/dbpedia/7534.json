The networks are mentioned as sub-groups within the Young Fabians in the document with file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7534/re-ranker-msmarco/22.txt, but they are not referred to as separate organizations or entities, and specifically a \"Finance Network\" of Young Fabians is not mentioned."

Since the Young Fabians organization itself runs these networks (e.g., Economy & Finance), it can be logically inferred that the parent organization of a specific Young Fabians network, such as the Finance Network, is indeed Young Fabians."
