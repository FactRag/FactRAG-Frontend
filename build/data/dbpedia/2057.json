He is also mentioned to have served in various capacities, including being President of the Ministry (Prime Minister) of Portugal. This information supports the triple that he was a Portuguese politician who served as Prime Minister of one of the many governments of the Portuguese First Republic.\n\nAdditionally, the document contains information about Rodrigues Gaspar, who was also a Portuguese military officer and politician, and was the President of the Ministry (Prime Minister) of one of the many governments of the Portuguese First Republic.
