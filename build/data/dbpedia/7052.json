However, there's no explicit statement that directly confirms or denies the subject being a Soviet film. The closest relevant information is:\n\n* File_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7052/re-ranker-msmarco/48.txt\n\t+ \"It quickly becomes apparent that Old Songs is a nostalgic and kitsch take on Ivan Pyriev\u2019s Cossacks of the Kuban, which is itself an epitome of Soviet mythology.\"\n* File_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7052/re-ranker-msmarco/101.txt\n\t+ \"Ivan Pyriev's musical spectacular, Cossacks of the Kuban (1948).\"\n\nThis suggests that \"Cossacks of the Kuban\" (1948) is an example of Soviet mythology, but it doesn't explicitly state whether the 1961 film \"The Cossacks\" is a Soviet film.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I would conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that this answer assumes there's no other relevant context or information provided.
