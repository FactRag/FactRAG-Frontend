Based on the context information provided, it seems like the triple being evaluated is not explicitly stated. However, based on the query \"The score of UEFA Women's Euro 1995 is 1\", I will assume that the triple being asked about is:\n\n\"The final game of UEFA Women's Euro 1995 had a certain score.\"\n\nHere's my evaluation of this triple based on the provided context information:\n\n* The first document mentions the date and location of the final game, but not its score.\n* The second document provides some general information about UEFA Women's Championship, but it does not mention the score of any specific year's tournament, including 1995.\n* The third and fourth documents are similar to each other and seem to be from a different source (Flashscore.com). They provide information about UEFA Women's EURO 2022, not UEFA Women's Euro 1995. They also do not mention the score of the final game.\n\nTherefore, based on this context information, it is not possible to determine if the triple \"The final game of UEFA Women's Euro 1995 had a certain score\" is supported or not, as there is no information about the score of that specific year's tournament. Hence:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

Therefore, based on the given context, the statement cannot be confirmed as correct."
