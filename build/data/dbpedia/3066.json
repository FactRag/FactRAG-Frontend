For example:\n\n* In the first document, it says: \"For the 1942 film, see The Great Gildersleeve (film).\"\n* In the second document, under the heading \"So how do the films hold up?\", it talks about the four wartime movies based on the characters in the radio show, including \"The Great Gildersleeve\" (1942) and describes its plot.\n* In other documents, there are more mentions of the film's title being \"The Great Gildersleeve\".\n\nGiven this information, I can confidently say that the statement is supported by the context.\n\nSo, my response will be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
