Furthermore, the document \"Ultimate Guide to Swiss Railway\" indicates that private railways supplement branch lines between villages, implying that Jona, being a railway station in Switzerland, could be owned by or operated under the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB/CFF/FFS). Therefore, the statement that The Jona railway station is owned by the Swiss Federal Railways is supported by the context."
