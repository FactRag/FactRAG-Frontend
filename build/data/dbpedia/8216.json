Specifically, the document for `15.txt` mentions \"Mick Norbury - Born on January 22, 1969 - Association football player\". While this does not explicitly state that Mick Norbury was born in Hemsworth, the documents for `7.txt` and others list numerous individuals with the surname Norbury who are associated with Hemsworth, suggesting a strong connection. Given the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that \"Mick Norbury\" could be referring to an individual from Hemsworth, supporting the triple."
