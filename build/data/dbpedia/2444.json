This suggests that he was involved in a significant event during the war, although it is not explicitly stated as the Battle of France. However, since the Battle of France was a part of the larger conflict, it can be inferred that Ken Gatward's actions were indeed related to this broader context.\n\nAdditionally, the documents mention Dunkirk and the occupation of France by Germany, which further supports the connection between Ken Gatward's actions and the broader conflict. Therefore, while the exact context is not explicitly stated as the Battle of France, it can be reasonably inferred that he was involved in significant events related to this period."
