Instead, it discusses its themes, characters, and story resonating with viewers in ways similar to Marvel superhero films, but ultimately concludes that it is an American icon.\n\nConsidering this nuance, I would say that the information in the documents supports the triple to some extent, but not entirely conclusively. Therefore:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}"
