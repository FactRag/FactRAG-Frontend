In fact, one of the documents mentions \"our Society's preservation efforts\" regarding the railroad, suggesting that it may still exist in some form.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it appears to support the triple that The subject of Boston and Lowell Railroad is a defunct Massachusetts railroad."

For instance, from document 41.txt, we learn that \"In 1830, a project was proposed to build a railroad between Boston and Lowell,\" and later in the same document, it mentions the historical context of railroads being developed during this period. While not explicitly stated as defunct, the historical nature of the information strongly suggests its status as a former operational railroad in Massachusetts."
