One document mentions a band called \"Rufus King\" and states that they formed in Woodland, California, while another document mentions an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat named Rufus King who was born in 1755. The documents do not provide enough information to conclusively determine whether the band is from the United States or not. However, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that the band is the same person as the historical figure mentioned in the other documents."
