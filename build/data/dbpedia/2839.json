It was established in 1997. The college's mandate is to license, govern and regulate the practice of teaching.\"\n\nHere is the evaluation:\n\n* \"Ontario College of Teachers is the regulatory body for the teaching profession in Ontario\" **(Supported by multiple documents)**: This statement is supported by several documents, including file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2839/re-ranker-msmarco/36.txt and file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2839/re-ranker-msmarco/74.txt.\n* \"and is the largest self-regulatory body in Canada\" **(Supported by multiple documents)**: This statement is also supported by several documents, including file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2839/re-ranker-msmarco/36.txt and file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2839/re-ranker-msmarco/64.txt.\n* \"It was established in 1997\" **(Not entirely accurate)**: While the document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2839/re-ranker-msmarco/74.txt states that the college was established on 20 May 1997, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2839/re-ranker-msmarco/60.txt) mentions a different establishment year (1996).\n* \"The college's mandate is to license, govern and regulate the practice of teaching\" **(Supported by multiple documents)**: This statement is supported by several documents, including file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2839/re-ranker-msmarco/36.txt.\n\nGiven the information above, I would say that the triple is partially correct. The first three statements are largely accurate according to the documents, but there is a discrepancy in the establishment year of the Ontario College of Teachers.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\nHowever, please note that this answer is conditional on considering the triple as partially correct. If the query requires an exact match with all three statements being true, then the output would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
