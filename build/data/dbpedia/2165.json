Specifically, document 40.txt states that the production team behind \"Frozen Planet\" includes executive producer Alastair Fothergill and series producer Vanessa Berlowitz, who were previously responsible for the award-winning series \"The Blue Planet (2001)\" and \"Planet Earth (2006)\". This suggests a connection between the two TV series.\n\nDocument 44.txt also mentions that Frozen Planet is a nature documentary series co-produced by BBC, which implies a relation to other BBC documentaries such as Planet Earth.\n\nTherefore, my evaluation is:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
