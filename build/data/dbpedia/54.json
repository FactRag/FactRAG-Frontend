Subject: Nicolas Prevost\n2. Predicate: is labeled as\n3. Object: 'Nicolas Prevost'\n\nIn the provided context information, there are multiple mentions of individuals named Nicolas (Prevost or Pr\u00e9vost) but none of them match this specific triple statement exactly. However, the most relevant mention is:\n\n\"Biography\n\nNOTE: careful to not confuse him with another Nicolas Prevost, Prevost-154\"\n\nThis suggests that there might be confusion between different individuals named Nicolas Prevost, which aligns with the idea that someone (or in this case, the system) needs to label them distinctively.\n\nTherefore, given the context information and considering the nuances of the statements provided, I have determined that the answer is 'yes'."
