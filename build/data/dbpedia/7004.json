However, considering the context of international collaborations and production details, it's more likely to be a film with both English-speaking actors (like Sam Waterston) and non-English speaking actors (such as Haing Ngor). Moreover, there isn't any information provided indicating that all dialogues are exclusively in English or specifying the language. Therefore, without additional context supporting an assertion of \"The Killing Fields\" being solely in English, the answer is 'no'."
