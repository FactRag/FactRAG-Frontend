While it mentions that Russian and Ukrainian have official status together with Romanian in Gagauzia, there is no specific mention of a currency for Gagauzia. However, it does mention that \"Moldova Leu (MDL; plural Lei), 1 Leu = 100 Bani (singular Ban)\" as the official currency of Moldova, and also notes that in Transnistria, a partially recognized state claimed by Moldova, the Transnistrian rouble is used instead. Therefore, while it can be inferred from this information, it's not explicitly stated that Gagauzia uses the Moldovan leu."

Gagauz and Ukrainian have significant regional speaker populations and are granted official status together with Russian in Gagauzia and Transnistria respectively.\" It also states, \"Moldova Leu (MDL; plural Lei), 1 Leu = 100 Bani (singular Ban). In Transnistria, a partially recognized state claimed in whole by Moldova, the Transnistrian rouble is used instead.\" However, since Gagauzia is not specifically mentioned to use a different currency and given that the context does not explicitly deny the usage of the Moldovan leu there, we can infer that the Moldovan leu could be the currency of Gagauzia."
