The second part \"scored\" is an action, and the third part \"11\" is a quantity.\n\nNow, I will search through the provided documents for information related to this triple.\n\nFrom file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1672/re-ranker-msmarco/49.txt:\n\n* The Utes scored 11 runs on 15 hits with one error, while the Lobos scored 14 runs on 15 hits with one error.\n\nThis document does not provide a direct answer to the triple but mentions that the Utes (Utah team) scored 11 runs. However, this information is in the context of a specific game, and it's unclear if it refers to the Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament as a whole.\n\nFrom file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1672/re-ranker-msmarco/36.txt:\n\n* The Utes scored six runs on 11 hits with six errors and allowed BYU nine runs on 11 hits with three errors.\n\nThis document also does not provide a direct answer to the triple but mentions that the Utes (Utah team) scored six runs, which is different from the statement \"scored 11.\"\n\nFrom file_path: /Users/stanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1672/re-ranker-msmarco/143.txt:\n\n* The Utah baseball team advances to the third round of the Mountain West Conference Tournament after upsetting No. 1 seed New Mexico 6-4 today.\n\nThis document mentions that Utah scored 6, not 11, and it does not provide a direct answer to the triple.\n\nBased on the provided information, I did not find any evidence that directly supports or contradicts the statement \"The 2000 Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament scored 11.\" Therefore:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
