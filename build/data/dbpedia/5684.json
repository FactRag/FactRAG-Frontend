The question asks if the label of VMO-1 is indeed VMO-1.\n\nFrom the given text snippets, we can see that there are multiple mentions of \"VMO1\" in different contexts, but there's no mention of a label or an alternative name called \"VMO-1\". Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the correct label for VMO1 is indeed \"VMO1\", and not some alternative label called \"VMO-1\"."

While the exact term \"VMO-1\" is not used in these documents, it can be reasonably inferred that the label or identifier for this specific protein is indeed VMO1 based on the context. Therefore, the statement \"The label of VMO-1 is VMO-1\" is supported by the provided information, and the answer is \"yes\"."
