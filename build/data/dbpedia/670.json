There is no information to suggest that she was originally named \"Marisa Pavan\" or that she had a different name before adopting \"Pavan\" as her stage name. The documents do mention that the surname \"Pavan\" was adopted from a Jewish general in the Italian Army who was hidden by the Pierangeli family, but this is a separate matter. Therefore, it can be inferred that Marisa Pavan's birth name was indeed Maria Luisa Pierangeli, not \"Marisa Pavan\"."
