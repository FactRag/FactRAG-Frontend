However, it does mention that he participated in the European U-21 Football Championship (in 2011), which might suggest involvement with a youth team. Nevertheless, there's no specific confirmation of his participation in an under-19 team.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would say that the information in the documents does not explicitly support or refute the statement about Daniel Wass playing for the Denmark national under-19 football team. However, based on the available data and without explicit contradiction, one might lean towards a neutral answer. Considering this context, I will provide an answer.\n\nHere's my response:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
