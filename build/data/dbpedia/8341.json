According to the text, Miltiades (Elpinice's father) left Athens to establish a colony on the Thracian Chersonese, but his son Cimon was born in Athens and suffered trouble there due to his family's debt. This implies that Elpinice, as a member of the Aecidae society, would also have been born in Athens."
