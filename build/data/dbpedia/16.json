One document mentions \"Pujol\" as a surname of the owner and executive chef of a restaurant, Enrique Olvera, but it does not mention Antonio Pujol.\n\nHowever, another document mentions a person named \"Pujol\" who is a member of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party, was elected on July 1, 2018. This might suggest that the Pujol in question is associated with Mexican politics or government.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that the information does not explicitly confirm Antonio Pujol's nationality as Mexico, but it also doesn't provide clear evidence to refute it. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, please note that this answer is based on a careful reading of the context information and might not be conclusive without further analysis or additional context."

The documents mention a person named Enrique Olvera and another Albert Pujols, but neither of them are described as being Mexican in nationality. There is no direct or indirect inference that can be made to support the claim that Antonio Pujol's nationality is Mexico based on the provided context."
