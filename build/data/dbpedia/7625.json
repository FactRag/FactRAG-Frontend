However, it's essential to note that none of the documents explicitly state that Caroline Bryant Donham or Linda Matson are from the United States.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`\n\nPlease keep in mind that this response assumes a loose interpretation of \"The Lady Who Lied\" referring to any individual mentioned in the context information.
