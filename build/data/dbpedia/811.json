Therefore, I do not have enough information to determine whether Leslie Mah is still a member of the group.\n\nThe correct response should be: {'output': 'no'}\n\nNote: The fact that Leslie Mah co-founded the band with Tracie Thomas and was part of its early formation implies that she may still be associated with the band in some capacity, but it does not confirm her current membership status."
