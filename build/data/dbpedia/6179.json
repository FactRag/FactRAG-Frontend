The text only mentions that stations are required to broadcast their call sign within 5 minutes of the top of the hour, and provides examples of call signs (e.g., \"World's Greatest Newspaper\" for WGN), but does not mention WTWW or its meaning. Therefore, the information in the documents does not support the triple."
