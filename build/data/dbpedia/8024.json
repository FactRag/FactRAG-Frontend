While Clarke did write popular science books, these are not mentioned as being his main genre; rather, he is primarily associated with science fiction literature.\n\nTherefore, while \"Popular Science\" writing was part of Clarke\u2019s body of work, stating that this is his genre might be misleading if it implies it's what he is best known for. His fame and primary contributions were in the realm of science fiction (including works such as 2001: A Space Odyssey).\n\nResponse:\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis answer reflects a more nuanced understanding that while Clarke did indeed write popular science books, his primary genre and what he is most known for does not align with being solely \"Popular Science\"."
