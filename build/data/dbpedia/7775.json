After then it flows through Tel Aviv...\" However, there is no information provided about where the river ends. The relevant document mentions \"Tel Qadadi, at the mouth of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv\", but this only specifies that the mouth of the Yarkon River is in Tel Aviv, and does not contradict the statement. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that the statement about the location of the mouth place of Yarkon River is correct."
