The most recent document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7942/re-ranker-msmarco/104.txt) mentions six current members, including Ryan Tedder, Zach Filkins, Drew Brown, Brent Kutzle, Eddie Fisher, and Brian Willett. However, this document is dated 13 October 2023, but it does not provide any information about the band's membership history or whether Zach Filkins was still a member at some point in the past.\n\nHowever, based on the fact that the other five members are consistently mentioned across all documents as current members, and there is no mention of Zach being replaced by someone else, we can infer that Zach Filkins might have been a part of OneRepublic for a while. \n\nStill given the information provided the correct answer is \"no\" because there's no way to confirm that the Zach Filkins was one of the current member as of today (considering the first file was created in 2007)"
