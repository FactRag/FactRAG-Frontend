While it is mentioned that the gala has a combination of modern media and folk customs, and that \"\u6625\u665a\" (ch\u016bn w\u01cen) is abbreviated by Chinese speakers, this does not necessarily mean that the primary or dominant language of the gala is Standard Chinese. The documents do mention that the gala is broadcast live to the world in Chinese, but they also mention that it has performances for different generations and cultural backgrounds, which suggests a broader use of languages within the show. Therefore, based on the provided context information, it cannot be definitively concluded that the language of CCTV New Year's Gala is Standard Chinese."
