The documents do confirm that the bridge exists and has been replaced by a park, but they also introduce the new name \"11th Street Bridge Park\". Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, please note that my evaluation is based on the provided context information and might not be comprehensive or definitive.

While the documents do not explicitly state \"The label of the 11th Street Bridge is '11th Street Bridge'\", it is reasonable to infer this given the consistent use of the name throughout the texts."
