However, it does not explicitly state that Palazzo Malta is the capital of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In fact, one of the documents mentions that \"It has a capital? Well not exactly...\" which suggests that the Sovereign Military Order of Malta does not have a traditional capital city. Therefore, the triple statement \"The capital of Sovereign Military Order of Malta is Palazzo Malta\" cannot be supported by the provided context information."
