However, the document also states that most users (over 99%) do not use Wikipedia as a bridge to discover primary and secondary sources, but rather as an end in itself. This suggests that while Wikipedia may contain summaries of information from secondary sources, its primary function is not as a means to further information, but rather as a source of information itself. Therefore, the statement \"The Orckestra is the primary topic of Wikipedia\" does not accurately reflect the information provided in the documents."
