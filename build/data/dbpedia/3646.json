However, this document does not specifically mention Wally Harris or his profession as a footballer.\n\nThe subsequent documents provide information about individuals with the name Wally/Wallace Harris, but they do not mention anything related to their death or connection to football. In fact, one of the documents mentions a Wallace Bruce \"Wally\" Harris who died in 2022, but it does not specify his profession or cause of death.\n\nGiven this information, I would conclude that the statement \"Wally Harris (footballer) died in Davos\" is not supported by the provided context. However, please note that there might be additional documents or information outside of this context that could support this claim.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
