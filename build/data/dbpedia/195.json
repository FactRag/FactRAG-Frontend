It only mentions \"the Giants\".\n\n**Document 2**\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_195/re-ranker-msmarco/44.txt\nThis document explicitly states that Century Allen \"Wally\" Milstead played with the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL).\n\n**Document 3**\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_195/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt\nThis document mentions Century Milstead playing tackle for the 1925 Giants, but it does not specify that he played for the New York Giants. It only mentions \"the Giants\".\n\n**Document 4**\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_195/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt\nThis document mentions Century Milstead, American College Football Hall of Fame tackle (Yale; NFL C'ship 1927, NY Giants), but it is unclear if \"NY\" refers to New York or not.\n\n**Document 5**\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_195/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt\nThis document is a duplicate of Document 3, and the same reasoning applies.\n\nBased on the information in the documents, there are some inconsistencies. However, considering that Document 2 explicitly states that Century Allen \"Wally\" Milstead played with the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL), I will give the benefit of the doubt and conclude that the triple is supported by the documents.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
