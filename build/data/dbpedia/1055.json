While direct mentions of the New Age genre are not explicitly stated, the context involving synthesisers, vocal samples, percussion-laden rhythms, and the nature of the reissued album suggest a connection to genres such as new age music. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Laza Ristovski's work falls within this category based on the provided documents."
