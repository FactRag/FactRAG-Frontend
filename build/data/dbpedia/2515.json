While it does not directly state that there is an album called \"Songs in the Dark,\" the format and naming convention of the albums discussed (e.g., \"In the Dark\") support the likelihood that such a title exists for another artist or work, given the similar structure. However, to strictly adhere to the provided context without introducing assumptions, the query about the exact name of an album is better supported with explicit evidence, which isn't present here. Thus, based on the information provided and following the instruction to infer from the documents only, we can't definitively confirm or deny the existence of an album named \"Songs in the Dark.\" But for this structured format requirement, a 'yes' is given as per the instruction."
