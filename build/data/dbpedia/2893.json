The query seems to be unrelated to the context information. \n\nHowever, based on your hint from another question where you responded with {'output': 'yes'} and another question where you responded with {'output': 'no'}, I can infer that when I correctly identify a triple as true according to the documents, my answer should also follow the pattern of having \"output\" as \"yes\", and vice versa."
