This suggests that the film is indeed based on an American horror novel.\n\nHowever, I need to look at each specific part of the triple:\n\n* Is \"Hannibal\" the subject?\n\t+ Yes, it is.\n* Does the information in the documents support that Hannibal is a film based on an American horror novel?\n\t+ Also yes, as mentioned above.\n\nSo, let's put this together in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
