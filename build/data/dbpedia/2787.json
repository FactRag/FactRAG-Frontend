However, since \"El Topo\" is actually a Chilean production but gained significant recognition through underground screenings in the United States, which initiated the midnight film movement, we can consider its influence within the scope of American independent cinema. Thus, the information supports the statement that it is a subject of American independent films.\n\nThe answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```\n\nThis conclusion reflects the documentary's discussion about how \"El Topo\" became associated with and influential in the American midnight film scene despite its origins outside the United States."
