It does not specify any associations between these rockets.\n\n**Document 3**: This document is identical to Document 2, so it doesn't provide any additional information about the Point Arguello Launch Complex B or its association with a specific rocket type (Terrier-Asp).\n\n**Document 4**: This document appears to be a discussion forum thread and provides some information about NASA's NERV project, which was launched on September 19, 1960, from Point Arguello California. However, it does not mention the Terrier-Asp rocket or its association with the Point Arguello Launch Complex B.\n\n**Document 5**: This document is identical to Document 2, so it doesn't provide any additional information about the Point Arguello Launch Complex B or its association with a specific rocket type (Terrier-Asp).\n\nBased on this analysis, I found no direct evidence in the provided documents that the Point Arguello Launch Complex B is associated with the Terrier-Asp. The documents do mention the Terrier-Asp as one of the rockets launched from the complex, but they don't specify any particular association between them.\n\nTherefore, my answer to your question is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
