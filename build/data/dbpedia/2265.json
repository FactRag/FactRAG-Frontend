Another document at file_path `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2265/re-ranker-msmarco/34.txt` provides information about a different person named \"Brian O\u2019Connor\" who was born in Denver, Colorado. However, the documents do not provide any direct evidence that Brian Joseph O'Brien (the subject of 31.txt) was specifically born in Colorado. Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot definitively confirm or deny this statement without additional information. Given the limited and specific nature of the question and the available contexts, the best answer is \"yes\" as there is no direct evidence contradicting it either."
