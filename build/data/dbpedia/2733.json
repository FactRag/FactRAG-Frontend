However, based on the context information and without prior knowledge, we can infer that the triple might be related to a specific aspect of the movie \"Educating Rita\". Given the context information provided, it seems like there are multiple documents with slightly different content.\n\nHowever, let's assume the triple is related to the plot of the movie \"Educating Rita\" as mentioned in one of the last two documents. The plot of the movie \"Educating Rita\" explores themes such as identity, class, and the transformative power of knowledge through the journey of Rita, an eager and determined young woman seeking self-discovery through education.\n\nGiven this information, let's answer the query based on the assumption that the triple is about the plot of the movie \"Educating Rita\".\n\nQuery: What makes \u201cEducating Rita\u201d a classic film?\n\nResponse:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThis response indicates that according to the provided context information, it seems like the triple \"What makes 'Educating Rita' a classic film?\" is indeed supported by the information in the documents."

While the documents do mention \"Educating Rita,\" they do not provide information about it being a label in the sense of an identifier or metadata, but rather discuss its content and themes. Therefore, based on the given context, the statement is not incorrect per se, but the specific phrasing of the query suggests we are looking for confirmation that the title itself (as a label) matches, which isn't directly addressed in the documents provided."
