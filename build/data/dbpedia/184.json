The context suggests that Frisz & Sympatisz is an album or movie title, and it is associated with Herman Brood, who is described as a singer/piano player. However, the term \"artist\" in general implies a person who creates original work in various forms (e.g., music, visual arts), which is not directly supported by the provided information. Therefore, based on this analysis, the answer would be 'no'."
