Additionally, it is mentioned that Rachel Goswell, along with Neil Halstead, formed the band Slowdive in Reading (document 48.txt). Another document (11.txt) mentions that Rachel Goswell was part of the band Slowdive since their primary school days.\n\nTherefore, the information supports the statement \"Rachel Goswell is a band member of Slowdive\" as correct."
