Although the specific resting place of Nicholas Brown, Jr., is not directly stated, it can be inferred from his lineage and familial connections that he too likely had a resting place there or nearby. However, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively confirm the exact resting place of Nicholas Brown, Jr.; therefore, the answer leans towards \"yes\" due to the family context but is not explicitly stated for absolute certainty. If the documents were more explicit about Nicholas Brown, Jr., then the response could be different."
