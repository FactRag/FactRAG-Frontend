Lewis was born in Berkley, Virginia, but later documents also mention him being born in Norfolk (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3370/re-ranker-msmarco/56.txt) and the DBPedia entry mentions that his birth place is uncertain (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3370/re-ranker-msmarco/57.txt). Therefore, it's not definitively clear from these documents alone that Berkley, Virginia was the only or primary birthplace of William H. Lewis."
