However, they do mention other newspapers such as Obskoy Rabochy, Sibirskaya Rech, Ob, Soldatsky Listok, and Chestnoye Slovo, which are related to the city of Novonikolalayevsk (now known as Novosibirsk). \n\nOne document mentions \"Soldatsky Listok illegal newspaper begins publication.\" in June, but there is no mention of Irkutskoye Slovo.\n\nAnother document mentions a list of events and publications, including newspapers such as Chestnoye Slovo, but again, there is no mention of Irkutskoye Slovo.\n\nThe last two documents are letters that seem to be discussing writing for a newspaper or journal. One letter mentions \"Notes on Philis\u00ac tinism\" in Novaya Zhizn, but still does not mention Irkutskoye Slovo.\n\nTherefore, based on the lack of any information about Irkutskoye Slovo in the provided context, I conclude that:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
