In fact, one of the documents mentions that Wilamowitz-Moellendorff vacated his chair at the University of Berlin in 1921, and that Jaeger succeeded him to the chair in Greek at Berlin in 1921. This suggests that Jaeger may have been a successor or colleague of Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, but not necessarily a student."
