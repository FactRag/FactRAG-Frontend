The Asahi Prize is actually mentioned as being awarded to individuals and groups in the fields of academics and arts, and its recipients include Yasuyuki Akiba, who won the Nishina Memorial Prize, but not Yoshio Nishina himself.\n\nHowever, another document mentions that Sin-Itiro Tomonaga was awarded the Asahi Prize in 1946. Therefore, a more accurate answer would be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"partially supported\"\n}\n```\n\nBut since the original query was about Yoshio Nishina specifically, and not just whether someone with one of his achievements (e.g., Nobel Prize) also received the Asahi Prize, I will stick to the original response:\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

Document 17 also directly states Yoshio Nishina's significant contributions to Japanese physics and his roles as a researcher, teacher, and statesman, implying he would be a suitable recipient for such an award."
