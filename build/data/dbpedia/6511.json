Specifically, it states that \"Kalash-e-Bozorg is located in the time zone Iran Standard Time. Official currency \u2014 IRR (Iranian Rial).\" Although this exact sentence was not given, it supports the existence of a location named Kalash in Ardabil province with specified geographic coordinates. The provided longitude 48 matches one of the documents that mention Kalash-e-Bozorg's geographical information. Thus, we can infer that the statement \"Kalash, Ardabil has a longitude of 48\" is supported by the context."
