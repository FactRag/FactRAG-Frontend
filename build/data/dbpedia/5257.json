However, I can see a document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5257/re-ranker-msmarco/52.txt) that talks about mob movies, but it doesn't mention Pat Frank or Alas, Babylon. Since there's no direct connection between the documents and the query, I'll assume there's no information to support this triple.\n* Elisabeth Domitien office Iraq: There's no mention of \"Elisabeth Domitien\" in any of the documents. The document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5257/re-ranker-msmarco/26.txt) that talks about \"Married to the Mob\" doesn't mention her name, and none of the other documents seem to be related to this person. Therefore, I can confidently say there's no information in these documents to support this triple.\n* Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela award Nobel Prize in Literature: There's a document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5257/re-ranker-msmarco/26.txt) that mentions \"Married to the Mob\", but it doesn't mention Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela or any information related to him winning the Nobel Prize in Literature. Therefore, I'll conclude that this triple is not supported by the provided documents.\n* The name of the film 'The Mob' is 'The Mob': This one seems straightforward since there's a document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5257/re-ranker-msmarco/37.txt) that explicitly mentions \"The Mob\" as the title of the film directed by Robert Parrish and starring Broderick Crawford.\n\nSo, here are the structured JSON responses:\n\n* Pat Frank author Alas, Babylon: {'output': 'no'}\n* Elisabeth Domitien office Iraq: {'output': 'no'}\n* Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela award Nobel Prize in Literature: {'output': 'no'}\n* The name of the film 'The Mob' is 'The Mob': {'output': 'yes'}"
