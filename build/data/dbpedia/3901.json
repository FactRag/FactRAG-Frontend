However, it indirectly supports this triple because the text talks about Ray Brassier being heavily influenced by various philosophers, such as Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle, Alain Badiou, and Quentin Meillassoux, which implies that he might be open to influences from other thinkers like Gilles Deleuze, who is mentioned in a context close to Ray Brassier's philosophical views."

While it does not explicitly state that Ray Brassier himself is influenced by Gilles Deleuze, it can be reasonably inferred from his association with Grant and other speculative realists who engage with Deleuze's philosophy, suggesting that such influence exists in the broader context of their work."
