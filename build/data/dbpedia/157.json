However, since the administrative district of Gmina Kramsk mentioned in one of the documents is a subset of Konin County, and given the fact that D\u0119bicz is explicitly stated to be within this district, it can be reasonably inferred that D\u0119bicz is indeed part of Konin County, even if this specific relationship is not explicitly stated."
