The first document even uses the phrase \"delightful blend of history, culture, and natural beauty\" to describe Hattingen, implying that it's a place worth visiting. The subsequent documents provide more factual information about Hattingen's location, history, and cultural significance, without ever contradicting the notion that its label is indeed \"Hattingen\". Therefore, based on the context information provided, the statement \"The label of Hattingen is Hattingen\" is supported by the documents."
