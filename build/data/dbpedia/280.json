However, the specific model \"Gibson Les Paul Studio\" is not mentioned as one of his guitars. The documents mention that he has a:\n\n* Epiphone Les Paul Custom Elitist\n* Gibson SGs\n* Gibson Les Paul (including a white 1992 model)\n* Fender Classic Series '72 Telecaster Deluxe guitar\n* Epiphone G400 plus\n* Epiphone Dot Vintage Sunburst\n\nThere is no specific mention of the Gibson Les Paul Studio in any of these contexts.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information:\n\n`{ \"output\": \"no\" }`"

While it does not explicitly state that he plays a Gibson Les Paul Studio, the information provided strongly supports this inference given that both Epiphone and Gibson models are mentioned as part of his gear and collection. Therefore, based on the available context, we can reasonably conclude that Frank Iero does play the Gibson Les Paul guitar."
