Instead, most of them mention various aspects of her life and work in passing, such as her awards, publications, and speaking engagements. The majority of the text actually discusses her novels, awards, and other topics related to her writing career rather than Rose Tremain herself."

They confirm that she is a British novelist who has published multiple novels and short story collections, won various literary awards, and her works have been translated into several languages. Therefore, the statement \"Rose Tremain is primarily about Rose Tremain\" is supported by the provided context."
