For example, document 39.txt says \"It [the 1998 Porsche 911 GT1-98] is also the third iteration of the 911 GT1, succeeding the 1997 911 GT1 Evo as well as the 1996 911 GT1, which were constructed by Porsche for the respective seasons.\" This suggests that the information in the documents supports the triple."
