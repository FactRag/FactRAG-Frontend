However, according to the context information, it seems that Pooja Sharma also goes by the name \"Pooja Mudgal\". This suggests that her full name may be Pooja Sharma (also known as Pooja Mudgal), rather than simply being Pooja Sharma. Therefore, the triple is not fully supported by the documents, and the value should be \"no\"."
