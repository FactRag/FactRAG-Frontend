However, it's implied in several documents that the UDC played a significant role in erecting monuments and memorials for Confederate-related figures and events. While they did not oppose honoring women through monuments, there are references indicating their preference against certain types of honors (e.g., ones limited to motherhood) and their efforts to construct memorials with educational purposes.\n\nThe query seems to be asking about a specific detail that is not directly addressed in the provided context. Therefore, without direct evidence pointing to this particular claim within the documents, the answer would lean towards \"no\" because we cannot confirm from these texts alone that the UDC built or was responsible for constructing the body of the Memorial to Women of the Confederacy.\n\nAnswer: {\"output\": \"no\"}"
