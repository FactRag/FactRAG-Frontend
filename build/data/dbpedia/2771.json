However, based on the context provided, it appears that there are multiple facts related to Fifth Avenue, and without further clarification or correction, it's unclear what the correct information should be. Nevertheless, based solely on the given context and without any additional information, I can infer that the claim might be referring to the fact that \"The Annual Fifth Avenue Arts Festival began in the summer of 1979,\" which is indeed a recurring event established in that year. However, since this specific statement is not marked as incorrect, it's possible that the claim is actually referring to something else related to Fifth Avenue and its events established in 1979, which might be incorrect. Therefore, without more context or information, I cannot confidently say what specifically is wrong about the claim, but I can conclude that the given statement does not provide sufficient evidence to support an evaluation of it as entirely correct or incorrect based on the provided facts.",
