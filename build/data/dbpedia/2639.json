Specifically:\n\n* \"In copyright law, a derivative work is an expressive creation that includes major copyrightable elements of a first, previously created original work...\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2639/re-ranker-msmarco/45.txt)\n* \"...the concept of derivative works holds significant importance, particularly in the context of copyright law.\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2639/re-ranker-msmarco/28.txt)\n* \"In copyright law, derivative works are original works of authorship that are based on earlier original works of authorship...\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2639/re-ranker-msmarco/52.txt)\n\nSince the subject of Derivative work is consistently related to copyright law across all documents, except for one that provides a US definition which also pertains to copyright law (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2639/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt), the triple is correct."
