The statement \"Corruption in the United States\" implies that corruption exists in the country as a whole, rather than just specific states. Therefore, it is likely that the hometown of the concept \"Corrupt Absolute\" (which refers to widespread or systemic corruption) would be the United States, as this is where the phenomenon is being discussed and evaluated."
