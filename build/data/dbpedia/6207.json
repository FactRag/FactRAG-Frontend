The park is located in Zealand Township, on the TransCanada Highway (Hwy 17) east of Dryden...\" Later, another document mentions,  \"Ontario Parks will support in principle the acquisition of property for addition to Aaron Provincial Park...\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** These phrases strongly indicate that Aaron Provincial Park is managed and likely owned by Ontario Parks.\n\n\n\n"

While it's not explicitly stated, the documents suggest that the park is managed and zoned by Ontario Parks, which implies some level of ownership or control. Therefore:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}` (with a note that this answer is based on partial support)"
