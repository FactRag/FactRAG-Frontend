In fact, the information indicates that Tomonaga worked under Yoshio Nishina for some period. Specifically, it states, \"His early work at RIKEN under Yoshio Nishina laid the foundation for his future endeavors in theoretical physics.\" This suggests a mentor-student relationship from the perspective of Tomonaga being the student and Nishina as the mentor, contrary to the statement provided."
