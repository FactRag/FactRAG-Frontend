However, this does not necessarily mean that Xingtai is the capital of Xing (state). The information suggests a historical connection between Xingtai and the state of Xing, but it does not specify that Xingtai served as its capital. Therefore, the query \"The capital of Xing (state) is Xingtai\" cannot be definitively confirmed or denied based on the provided context, resulting in an output of \"no\"."
