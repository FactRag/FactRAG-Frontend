Additionally, this is a different person with a similar name.\n* The third and fourth documents mention that Patrick Joseph Sullivan Jr. passed away unexpectedly on March 14, 2024, in Cheshire, CT, which suggests that he was living there at the time of his death.\n* The fifth document mentions that Joseph A. Sullivan (not Patrick) passed away peacefully on January 29, 2015, in Exeter, N.H., but does not mention a connection to Santa Barbara, California.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that none of the documents specifically state that Patrick Joseph Sullivan died in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
