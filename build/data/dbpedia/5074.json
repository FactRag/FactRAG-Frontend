However, it is stated that she also has three children with her former husband Terry Quinn, implying that she and Don Johnson have more than one child together, or possibly they are not in a relationship at the time of having Jesse.\n\nThe document file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5074/re-ranker-msmarco/57.txt mentions that Don Johnson has five children and lists them as Jesse, Dakota, Atherton, Jasper, and Deacon. However, this does not directly confirm the statement about Patti D'Arbanville's relationship with Don Johnson.\n\nThe document file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5074/re-ranker-msmarco/111.txt provides information about Patti D'Arbanville's family, but it only mentions her son Jesse and three children with Terry Quinn, without explicitly stating that she had a relationship with Don Johnson. \n\nTherefore, the statement \"Patti D'Arbanville's partner is Don Johnson and they have one son\" cannot be confirmed as correct according to the provided documents."

This can be inferred from the following details:\n\n- From `66.txt`: \"Johnson has a son, Jesse, 16, by actress Patti D\u2019Arbanville,\" which indicates that Don Johnson and Patti D'Arbanville had a son named Jesse.\n- From `23.txt` and `57.txt`: They both mention the same information about Jesse being their son from a previous relationship.\n\nTherefore, the triple \"Patti D'Arbanville's partner is Don Johnson and they have one son\" is supported by the given documents."
