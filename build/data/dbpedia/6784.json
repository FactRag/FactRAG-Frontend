The documents correctly state that the country code for Sri Lanka is +94. However, the response provided in the triple incorrectly states that the calling code and telephone numbers are synonymous, whereas they refer to different aspects related to phone numbers (the former being the prefix you dial before a local number, the latter referring to the format of numbers). Therefore, the answer is \"no\" because the given statement does not accurately represent the information in the documents."
