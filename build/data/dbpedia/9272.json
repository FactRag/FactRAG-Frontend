This implies that they are from the United States, but also specifies their location as Brooklyn, New York, which is a city within the country. However, when evaluating whether this supports the triple \"PFFR is from United States\", we should consider if the statement is an exhaustive and correct representation of PFFR's origin. The information provided does indeed indicate that PFFR is based in the United States, but there is no contradiction or evidence to suggest otherwise. However, given the context, it seems more accurate to evaluate this as 'no' because the original triple is too broad and could be interpreted as saying they are solely from the US (ignoring their Brooklyn, New York location), which isn't explicitly supported by the provided information."
