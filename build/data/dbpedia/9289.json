However, there is no mention of French occupation of Malta. The text only mentions the Knights of St John arriving in Malta in 1530 and founding the city of Valletta in 1566 after the Great Siege of Malta.\n\nThe correct answer would be a historical fact related to French occupation of Malta, which is not provided in the context information."
