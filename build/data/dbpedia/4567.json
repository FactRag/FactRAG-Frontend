Born on December 8th 1927 in L\u00fcneburg...\"\n* This suggests that he was born before his death.\n* Since the date of birth is mentioned as December 8, 1927, and the date of death is mentioned as November 6, 1998, it implies that the order of events (birth before death) is consistent.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the triple appears to be correct."
