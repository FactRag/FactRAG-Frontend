However, this is not explicitly stated as the main category of the film.\n* None of the other documents mention LGBT-related horror films or Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead in that context.\n\nBased on these findings, I conclude that the information in the documents does not strongly support the triple that Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead is a film in the category LGBT-related horror films. However, there are some hints and mentions that could be related to this category, but they are not conclusive or explicit enough.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
