It also supports the NHS Long Term Plan and believes that prevention, empowering people to control their own health, harnessing new technologies and improving the quality of patient care and health outcomes are key to ensure a sustainable NHS. Additionally, it is mentioned that Pfizer's manufacturing site in Park Royal, London, as well as its global cold chain packaging and distribution facility in Havant, Hampshire, will close in 2017 and 2020 respectively, but this information does not contradict the fact that Pfizer produces pharmaceutical drugs in the UK."
