However, none of them explicitly state their full name as \"(Hiday\u0259t Orucov)\".\n\nThe closest mention of Hidayat Orujov's full name is in document 43.txt, which states \"Hidayat Heydarov went down in the history of Azerbaijani sports...\". This suggests that Hidayat's last name might be spelled differently than \"Orucov\".\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would conclude that the triple \"(The full name of Hidayat Orujov is (Hiday\u0259t Orucov))\" is not supported by the documents.\n\nHere is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
