The documents mention Alternative R&B and its relationship to Contemporary R&B, but they also provide details about Contemporary R&B being a genre that combines elements of rhythm and blues with pop, soul, funk, hip hop, and electronic music. Since \"Any Love\" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that Misia's song style would fit into the broader category of Contemporary R&B due to its genre characteristics described in the text."
