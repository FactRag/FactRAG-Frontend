The film is indeed directed by William A. Wellman and stars Glenn Ford, Janet Blair, Charles Ruggles. Additionally, document 13 provides a brief overview of the film's story, mentioning John Montgomery as the main character and his efforts to build and fly gliders. However, there is no specific information about the film being released in San Diego, California on September 4, 1946.\n\nDespite this discrepancy, the core statement \"Gallant Journey is a 1946 American historical film directed by William A.
