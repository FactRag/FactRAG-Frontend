This indicates that her full-born name is indeed \"Alexandra Chando\".\n* In document 6 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8318/re-ranker-msmarco/51.txt), it says \"Bio: Alexandra Chando (born July 28, 1986 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) is an American actress.\" Again, her full name is listed as \"Alexandra Chando\".\n\nGiven this information, the triple \"The full name of Alexandra Chando is Chando, Alexandra\" is actually incorrect.
