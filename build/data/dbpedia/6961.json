However, based on the context, it appears that the film's subject matter includes a wide range of topics such as sex education, same-sex attraction, wealth inequality, and more, but there is no mention of black-and-white films being a specific subject. Therefore, the answer to the query \"The subject of I Am Curious (Blue) is Black-and-white films\" is \"no\"."
