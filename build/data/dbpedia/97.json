It also talks about Charles III of Bourbon and Guglielmo Borremans. There is no mention of Francesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani or his titles.\n* **Document 2**: This document discusses the Beati Paoli, a secret sect that allegedly existed in Sicily. However, it does not provide any information about Francesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani's titles or affiliations.\n* **Document 3**: The text describes a historic novel set during pre-Italian unification time and mentions Garibaldi, Nino Bixio, and the Conca d'Oro. There is no mention of Francesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani or his titles in this context.\n* **Document 4**: This document discusses the Palace of Valletta and its history. It mentions the Marquis of Villabianca but does not specify whether he was also known as the Count of Belforte.\n\nBased on these evaluations, I conclude that:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThe information in the documents does not support the triple statement that Francesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani is also known as the Marquis of Villabianca and the Count of Belforte."
