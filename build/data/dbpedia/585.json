Additionally, it is mentioned that Inukai became president of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai in 1929.

For example, one document states, \"The Kakushin Club then merged with the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai, and Inukai continued as a senior member.\" Another mentions his role as president of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai: \"In 1929, after the sudden death of Tanaka Giichi, Inukai became president of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai.\" Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Inukai Tsuyoshi was indeed a member of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai."
