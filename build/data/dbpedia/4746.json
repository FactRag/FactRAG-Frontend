This suggests that the triple is correct, indicating that Arizona Summit Law School is indeed a private institution.\n\nNote: The term \"university\" specifically is not mentioned in any of the context information to describe Arizona Summit Law School. However, based on the general description of it as a private law school and institution, I have inferred that the intention was likely to indicate it is a private educational institution, which would encompass both university-like institutions and colleges/schools that provide higher education."
