The documents mention that there is also a Headquarters Air Force (HAF) led by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), but this is not the leader of the Department itself.\n\nNote: I assume that \"leader\" refers to the highest-ranking official or person in charge, rather than other organizational roles."
