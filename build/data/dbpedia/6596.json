However, it is mentioned that he was part of the Duke staff under head coach Mike Krzyzewski from 1983-89, which suggests that he did have a presence at Duke during this time period."

The earliest year mentioned related to Bob Bender is 1983 when he started his coaching career at Duke as an assistant coach, and the first head coaching position he held was at Illinois State starting from 1989. However, there is no specific mention of a \"season\" in 1989 for Bob Bender based on the given context."
