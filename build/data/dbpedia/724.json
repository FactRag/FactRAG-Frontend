Some of them mention that it was opened in 1922 (document 42) or 1924 (documents 11, 22, and 83), but none of them specifically categorize it as \"Category: Masonic buildings completed in 1924\".\n\nHowever, document 69 mentions the Jerusalem Temple Lodge No. 90 Masonic body was formed in October 1850, which is an earlier date than the completion dates mentioned for the Masonic Temple.\n\nDocument 42 mentions that the building was built in 1922 and served as a home for 10 Masonic organizations, which suggests that it is indeed a masonic building. However, the specific category \"Category: Masonic buildings completed in 1924\" does not appear to be supported by any of the documents.\n\nTherefore, based on my evaluation, I conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
