            "reason": "The context information does not mention Art Nouveau directly, but based on the timeline of Dudovich's active years (1878-1962) and his work as a poster artist during the early 20th century, it suggests he was more aligned with Modernism or possibly Art Deco, rather than specifically Art Nouveau. His focus on advertising posters and \"mural art\" indicates a style that is more characteristic of the interwar period's modernist trends, which often diverged from the flowing lines and organic forms associated with Art Nouveau.",
