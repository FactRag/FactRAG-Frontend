However, this information does not provide a clear indication that an election took place in Montana in 1921.\n* The closest relevant information is the text \"Jeannette Rankin was the first woman elected to Congress.  The Republican Representative from Montana was elected in 1916 and sworn in on March 4, 1917.\" which indicates that Jeannette Rankin was indeed elected in 1916.\n* However, this does not necessarily mean that there were elections held in all states in 1921 (the previous year of the United States Senate election in Montana, 1922). The context information suggests that the US Senate election took place in 1922, with Jeannette Rankin being mentioned as a Representative from Montana who was elected in 1916.\n* Given this information, it is unclear whether an election for Montana specifically took place in 1921.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information:\n\n{ \"output\": \"no\" }"
