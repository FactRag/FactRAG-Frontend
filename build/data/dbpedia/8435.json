According to file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8435/re-ranker-msmarco/29.txt, it is stated that Malawi's population grew 2.69% from 2019 to 2020, adding about 500,000 people to the population. Additionally, projections suggest that Malawi's population will reach 66.21 million by the end of the century (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8435/re-ranker-msmarco/29.txt). Given the current population estimate of approximately 16,407,000 in 2013, and considering the rapid population growth rate mentioned in the documents, it is reasonable to infer that Malawi's population will indeed triple by 2099."
