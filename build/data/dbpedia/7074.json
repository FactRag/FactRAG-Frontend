However, they do not explicitly state that his full name is \"Bill Richmond\". The first document mentions \"Bill Richmond\" as a writer's name, but subsequent documents provide additional information, including his full name \"William Earle Richmond\". Therefore, the triple statement that the full name of Bill Richmond (writer) is simply \"Bill Richmond\" cannot be confirmed based on the provided context."

They confirm his full name as Bill Richmond and mention his work with Jerry Lewis in films such as \"The Nutty Professor,\" supporting the triple that his full name is indeed Bill Richmond."
