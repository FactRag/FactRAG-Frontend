The new structure includes Army Corps Divisions.\n* In the same document, the Army Corps Divisions are listed with their respective sectors, indicating a hierarchical structure where Army Corps are the top-level units.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, it appears that the command structure of List of Spanish Republican divisions is indeed Corps."
