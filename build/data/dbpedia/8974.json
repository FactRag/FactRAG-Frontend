In fact, according to one of the documents, the territory of Novorossiya Governorate fell largely within a slightly wider area known in Ukrainian as the Stepovyna and in Russian as the Stepp \"Steppe Land\", or Nyz \"Lower Land\"."

While they contain details about Novomoskovsk, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and Novorossiya, there is no evidence linking Novomoskovsk specifically as the capital of Novorossiya Governorate."
