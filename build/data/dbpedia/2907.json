The documents do not provide extensive information about environmental engineering principles or concepts related to dry wells. However, the topic of dry wells does relate to broader areas like civil engineering, hydrology, and sustainability, but not specifically to \"Environmental engineering\" in general.\n\nIf you would like me to refine my analysis based on different criteria, feel free to ask!"
