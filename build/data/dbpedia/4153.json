There's no mention of a specific film called Love.\n* File 3: It talks about various movies filmed in Montenegro, including Papillon (1973) and Nymph. Again, there's no mention of a specific film called Love.\n* File 4: It discusses Serbia and Montenegro setting a new course for itself after the fall of the Milosevic regime, but it doesn't mention the country where the film Love is located.\n* File 5: It talks about the geography and climate of Serbia and mentions that three mountain ranges meet in the south of Serbia, but there's no connection made to the location of a specific film called Love.\n\nBased on this analysis, I couldn't find any information in the documents that directly supports or denies the triple \"The country where the 2005 film Love is located is Serbia and Montenegro.\" Therefore:\n\n```\n{\n    \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

However, given that the documents do discuss film production activities in the country (such as the filming of \"Papillon\" and \"Nymph\"), it is reasonable to infer that other films could also be shot there. The query does not contradict any information provided; therefore, without explicit denial or additional context suggesting otherwise, we can respond affirmatively."
