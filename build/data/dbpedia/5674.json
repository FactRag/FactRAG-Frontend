Document 9.txt mentions him scoring a 'dashing' 96 in the second innings of his first-ever first-class match, implying he played at least one match, but the actual number of matches is not specified as 4."

While it mentions he played 19 matches for Sussex, there is no specific statement regarding exactly 4 matches. Therefore, the claim that David Mordaunt played 4 matches cannot be supported by the given context."
