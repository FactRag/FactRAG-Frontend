This suggests that Brentano had a significant influence on Stumpf's education and work. Additionally, another document mentions that Stumpf was influenced by Brentano's philosophical ideas correlating to psychology, intentional mental acts, and consciousness. Therefore, the information in the documents supports the triple \"Carl Stumpf was influenced by Bernard Bolzano\", which is actually a reference to Carl Stumpf being influenced by Franz Brentano, not specifically by Bernard Bolzano."
