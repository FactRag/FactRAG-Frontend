Clarke's career, awards, and accomplishments, but none of them mention him being notable for someone else's work. The text describes him as a writer, inventor, futurist, and television series host, and highlights his own works such as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"Rendezvous with Rama\". This suggests that he is notable for his own work, making the triple correct according to the documents."
