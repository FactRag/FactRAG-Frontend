Additionally, they mention that during the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396), Vidin was an important city and its despots were influential figures in the Empire.\n\nThe documents also provide information about the Baba Vida fortress, which is described as the main landmark of Vidin and a strong fortress during the Second Bulgarian Kingdom. This suggests that Vidin played a significant role in the history of the Second Bulgarian Empire.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it appears to support the triple \"The capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire is Vidin.\""
