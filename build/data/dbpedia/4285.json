This suggests that while Cornelis Johannes van Houten may have been involved in the discovery, he is not credited as the sole discoverer of 1868 Thersites."

It was discovered by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Dutch-American astronomer Tom Gehrels at the U.S. Palomar Observatory, California, on 24 September 1960.\" This supports that Cornelis Johannes van Houten is indeed the discoverer of 1868 Thersites."
