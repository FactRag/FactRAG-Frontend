However, according to the provided context information, Bisheh Mahalleh is a village in Karipey Rural District, but there is no mention of Karipey Rural District being a subdivision of Babol County. Instead, Babol Kenar District and Bandpey-ye Sharqi District are mentioned as subdivisions of Babol County."
