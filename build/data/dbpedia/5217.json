This is consistent with the context information, which mentions that he was \"killed along with his daughter Rima Al Akkad Monla in the 2005 Amman bombings\".\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`\n\nbecause the statement contains incorrect information about Moustapha Al Akkad's filmography."
