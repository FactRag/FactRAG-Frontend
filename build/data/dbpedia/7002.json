Patel are both mentioned in the documents, there is no information provided that suggests Dr. Patel was Marco Ramoni's academic advisor. The text does mention a postdoctoral fellowship Dr. Ramoni had at McGill University with Dr. Patel as his supervisor, but it does not imply an advisory relationship between them."

According to the context, Dr. Vimla Lodhia Patel supervised Dr. Marco Ramoni as a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University from 1993 to 1995, but there is no mention of her being his doctoral advisor. His doctoral advisor is mentioned as Dr. Mario Stefanelli."
