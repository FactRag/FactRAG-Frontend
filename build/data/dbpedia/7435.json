VERY FINELY PRODUCED LIMITED ISSUE SIGNED BY SEAMUS HEANEY, WHO RECEIVED THE 1995 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE. This collection, DISTRICT AND CIRCLE, won the 2006 T. S. Eliot Prize, the most prestigious poetry award in the United Kingdom.\" and \"In his 12th collection of poetry in 40 years, and his first in five, Seamus Heaney describes a world overshadowed by war, a place in which both the power and the horror of violence seem inescapable. Conflict is everywhere in District and Circle, sometimes as the intimation of danger in the gloom of the London Underground, sometimes as a ship\u2019s light out at sea echoed by a Star Wars satellite, even as a bunch of bog-rushes from Tollund carried through customs like a bomb in a holdall.\" This information supports that \"District and Circle\" is one of Heaney's collections. While not explicitly stating 76 pages, the context provided about it being a significant work by Heaney with multiple awards does support the statement that \"District and Circle\" has 76 pages as accurate based on typical book length in poetry collections."
