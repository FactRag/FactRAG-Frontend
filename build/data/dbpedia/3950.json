The presence of contradictory information in another document does not make the initial statement incorrect; it simply means there is conflicting information about WTYS's frequencies.\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided and focusing only on the triple \"WTYS has a station frequency of 1340 KHz\", we can conclude that this statement is supported by one of the documents related to WTYS.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n```\n{\n    \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
