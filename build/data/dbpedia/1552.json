This information can be found in the first document:\n\n\"On Facebook, the band posted a comment on November 18, 2012 with a picture of their new album cover for 'Projekt Herz' saying 'It all begins Thursday'. \"\n\nThis implies that by November 18th, Paul Bartzsch was already part of the band. However, there is no direct confirmation in the provided context information about whether he was specifically on vocals during the release of Projekt Herz.\n\nThe only concrete piece of information is that the EP \"Projekt Herz\" indeed features Paul Bartzsch as a member of We Butter the Bread with Butter, but it does not explicitly confirm his role as vocalist at the time of its release.\n\nGiven this context, the answer would be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`\n\nThis indicates that while Paul Bartzsch was part of We Butter the Bread with Butter and Projekt Herz indeed features him, there's no explicit confirmation in the provided documents about his specific role (vocals) at the time of Projekt Herz's release."
