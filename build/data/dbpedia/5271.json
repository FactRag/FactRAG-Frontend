Marland\".\n* However, the second document references a biography of \"William C. Marland\", which suggests that he may be the same person mentioned in the previous documents.\n* Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the triple is correct, as there could be another William Marland with a similar name and profile.\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided, I would say:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`\n\nThe triple \"William C. Marland's name is William C. Marland\" may be incorrect, or at least it cannot be confirmed as correct based on the available context information."
