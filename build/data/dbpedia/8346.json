It also mentions that construction on four fire lookouts in the park began in the 1930s.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find any direct information or evidence in the provided documents that explicitly states the Shadow Mountain Lookout is governed by the National Park Service. The text only mentions the \"Park Service administrators and designers\" as part of a quote about the type of rustic design advocated for the lookouts, but it does not imply governance.\n\nTherefore, I would evaluate this query as:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
