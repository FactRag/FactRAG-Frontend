Additionally, there's a settlement agreement related to his sacking from the Hunter club (presumably referring to Newcastle Jets), which implies he was no longer with the team at that time. Furthermore, his return to training suggests he may have been on the sidelines due to injury rather than actively playing for the team. Therefore, the claim that Jason Culina currently plays for Newcastle Jets FC is incorrect based on the provided context.",
