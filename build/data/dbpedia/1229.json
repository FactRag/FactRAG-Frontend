Etox, the second sports car produced after STC-16 of Anadol in Turkey...\" which further supports the fact that Diardi is a sports car and was likely manufactured in Turkey, although it does not explicitly mention Diardi's production.\n\nOverall, based on this information, the triple seems to be correct."
