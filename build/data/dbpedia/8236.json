However, this does not necessarily imply that \"Letchworth\" is its own label.\n* The second document provides historical information about Letchworth, including its location and population in the 19th century. It mentions that the living is a rectory, but it does not mention anything about a label or nickname for Letchworth.\n* The third document also discusses Letchworth Park History and mentions a label from a stereocard circa 1875, but again, there is no indication of \"Letchworth\" being used as its own label.\n\nBased on this analysis, the triple is likely incorrect. Therefore:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

This can be inferred from references like \"from Letchworth Park History\", \"LETCHWORTH, a parish in the hundred of Broadwater\", and other mentions throughout the texts."
