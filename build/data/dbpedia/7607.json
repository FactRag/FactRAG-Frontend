The key phrases and sentences that support this triple include:\n\n* \"Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal is a movie that criticizes the behavior of U.S. Presidential candidate John Forbes Kerry on his return from Vietnam.\"\n* \"The Sinclair station group collectively reaches 24 percent of U.S. television households... 'Stolen Honor' focuses on Kerry's anti-war testimony to Congress in 1971 and its effect on American POWs in Vietnam.\"\n\nThese mentions clearly indicate that Stolen Honor is a movie/documentary film, making the triple correct according to the documents."
