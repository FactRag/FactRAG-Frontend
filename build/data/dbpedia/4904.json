Among those victories are the ones that occurred in 1954, 1957, 1958, and 1961. Since he was one of the most successful Australian drivers ever and achieved a victory in the specific year mentioned (1957), it is reasonable to infer that Lex Davison would have been the fastest driver at least among the competitors who participated in that race. Therefore, the statement \"The fastest driver in the 1957 Australian Grand Prix was Lex Davison\" is supported by the information given."
