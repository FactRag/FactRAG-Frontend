The documents mention that Rio Tinto PLC's Canadian subsidiary, Rio Tinto Canada Holding Inc., merged with Canadian company Alcan Inc. to create Rio Tinto Alcan, but they do not indicate a subsiding relationship between the two companies."

For instance, one document states: \"It was created on 15 November 2007 as the result of the merger between Rio Tinto PLC's Canadian subsidiary, Rio Tinto Canada Holding Inc., and Canadian company Alcan Inc.\"\n- Another passage confirms that Rio Tinto Alcan is a subsidiary under Rio Tinto: \"The aluminium division of Rio Tinto (previously known as Rio Tinto Alcan) is a subsidiary of Rio Tinto, based in Montreal.\"\n\nBased on these pieces of information, it is clear that the documents support the idea that Rio Tinto Group subsidizes or owns Rio Tinto Alcan through a parent-subsidiary relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct response to this query would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```"
