It mentions \"Dajab\u00f3nMunicipal Core23,20925,24531,650 Rep\u00fablica Dominicana [Dominican Republic]Sovereign State8,562,5419,445,28110,773,983\".\n* Although the document does not explicitly mention population density, it does provide information about urbanization (C 2022) Rural7,155 Urban24,495. This implies that the population is partially rural and partially urban.\n* However, there is no direct or indirect evidence in any of the documents to support the specific claim \"The population density of Dajab\u00f3n Province is auto\".\n* Therefore, I conclude that the triple statement is not supported by the provided context information.\n\nHere's my response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

However, there is no mention of the population density of Dajab\u00f3n Province specifically; instead, it details the population of the municipal core and some census figures. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot confirm or deny the population density of Dajab\u00f3n Province being \"auto\" (assuming \"auto\" was a placeholder for a specific value), hence the answer is \"no\"."
