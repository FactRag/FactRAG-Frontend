The only mention of SiteGround's logo is in a sentence describing their new brand identity, which does not provide any details about the actual file name or path.\n\nSo, the statement \"The logo of SiteGround is File:SiteGround.Com_Inc._Logo.png\" cannot be supported by the documents, hence the response is \"no\"."
