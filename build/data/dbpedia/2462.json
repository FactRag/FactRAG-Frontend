However, considering the context of the operation and his role as Commander Australian Contingent, it can be inferred that he was likely involved in battles or combat operations during the course of Operation Slipper.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"

While they do not explicitly state that he was involved in a specific battle, the context mentions his service during Operation Slipper, which refers to Australia's contribution to the conflict in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. Since Operation Slipper involved combat operations, it is reasonable to infer that Ken Gillespie would have been involved in these operations as part of his role, even if not explicitly named in the documents for every single battle."
