In fact, one of the documents mentions that the protagonist, Jack Campbell, played by Max Martini, enters an underground fight club to avenge his brother's beating and rescue his hometown from a corrupt businessman who controls the town. This suggests that the movie might have a different plot or director than what is stated in the triple.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the information does not support the triple, and my response is \"no\"."
