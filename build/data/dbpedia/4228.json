According to the information provided:\n\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4228/re-ranker-msmarco/14.txt, Andrew \"Andy\" Roberts is born in 1946 and is an English musician.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4228/re-ranker-msmarco/32.txt, Andy Roberts (d. 1995) is mentioned as the lead guitarist and vocalist for Linus, but no specific birth or activity period is mentioned.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4228/re-ranker-msmarco/104.txt, Andy Roberts has been active in the Central Pa music scene for many years, starting by age 15 and graduating from Berklee College of Music in 1989.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4228/re-ranker-msmarco/128.txt, Guitarist and singer-songwriter Andy Roberts talks about his journey in music and his collaborations starting from the 1960s.\n\nThe query asks whether Andy Roberts (musician) was active from 1960. Given that one of the documents mentions that Andy Roberts has been active since the 1960s, it is reasonable to infer that he was indeed active during this period. Therefore, the response is \"yes\"."
