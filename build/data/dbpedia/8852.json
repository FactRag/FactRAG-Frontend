The document from file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8852/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt explicitly states that \"The DPR was created by Russian-backed paramilitaries in 2014, and it initially operated as a breakaway state until it was annexed in 2022. The entire territory of DPR is viewed as sovereign territory of Ukraine by nearly all UN member states.\" Additionally, the document from file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8852/re-ranker-msmarco/15.txt confirms that Donetsk is the capital city of the Donetsk Oblast, which is currently occupied by Russia as the capital of the Donetsk People's Republic."
