However, given the query's structure and lack of clear reference to an entity called \"Red Mitchell\" being a record label (which it doesn't seem to be based on the biographical details), we can reasonably deduce this isn't correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis is because Red Mitchell was an American jazz double-bassist, composer, lyricist, and poet. He did record under various labels as mentioned in the context (Bethlehem Records, Contemporary Records, Pacific Jazz, etc.), but 'Red Mitchell' is not a label itself according to this information."
