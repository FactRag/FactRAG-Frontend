We can see from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8405/re-ranker-msmarco/79.txt that there are statistics about minority groups, including Roma people, which were available in 2017.\n\nTherefore, the context information supports the triple:\n\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}"
