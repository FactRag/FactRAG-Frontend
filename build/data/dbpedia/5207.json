The documents do provide various longitudes for East London, but all are different from 52, such as:\n\n* 27\u00b053\u203259.49\u2033 East (from document with file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5207/re-ranker-msmarco/55.txt)\n* 27.91162 (from document with file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5207/re-ranker-msmarco/81.txt)\n* 27.916667 (from document with file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5207/re-ranker-msmarco/66.txt)\n* 27\u00b054'41.83\u2033E (from document with file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5207/re-ranker-msmarco/53.txt)\n\nTherefore, the information in the documents does not support a longitude of 52 for East London, Eastern Cape."

The correct longitude according to multiple sources is around 27.916667 or -27.9153 (considering the various formats provided), not 52. Therefore, the statement that \"East London, Eastern Cape has a longitude of 52\" is incorrect."
