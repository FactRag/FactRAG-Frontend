For example, one document mentions that Priority Records gave many listeners a look into a world that was unfamiliar to them through N.W.A's music, and another document states that \"It was the home of 'Fuck Tha Police' and N.W.A\" - implying that N.W.A was indeed affiliated with Priority Records."
