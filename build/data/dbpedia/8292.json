The documents mention that Clonezilla source codes are the running programs themselves, which are written in scripts (bash or perl). However, this does not necessarily mean that the Clonezilla program is written in Shell script itself. Therefore, based on the given information, it cannot be confirmed that Clonezilla is written in Shell script."

This statement implies that the source code of Clonezilla itself is not a script. If it were true that Clonezilla is written in Shell script, then the source code would indeed be a script. However, since the source codes are described as \"the running programs themself\", this suggests that they are written in other programming languages, which are compiled to create the executable program, rather than being scripts themselves.",
