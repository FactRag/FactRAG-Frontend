Yet, his name suggests he could potentially be of Austrian origin, as the surname \"Pitsch\" is more commonly found in Austria. Additionally, the context mentions an Alfred Pitsch who was employed by a Finnish circus, indicating connections beyond Germany. Therefore, without explicit birthplace information, attributing his birth to Germany alone is not substantiated.",
