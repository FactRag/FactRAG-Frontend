    "object": "Hans Grundig (February 19, 1901 \u2013 September 11, 1958) was a German painter and graphic artist associated with the New Objectivity movement.He was born in Dresden and, after an apprenticeship as an interior decorator, studied in 1920\u20131921 at the Dresden School of Arts and Crafts. He then studied at the Dresden Academy from 1922\u20131923.  During the 1920s his paintings, primarily portraits of working-class subjects, were influenced by the work of Otto Dix. Like his friend Gert Heinrich Wollheim, he often depicted himself in a theatrical manner, as in his Self-Portrait during the Carnival Season (1930). He made his first etchings in 1933.Politically anti-fascist, he joined the German Communist Party in 1926, and was a founding member of the arts organization Assoziation revolution\u00e4rer bildender K\u00fcnstler in Dresden in 1929.Following the fall of the Weimar Republic, Grundig was declared a degenerate artist by the Nazis, who included his works in the defamatory Degenerate Art exhibition  in Munich in 1937. He expressed his antagonism toward the regime in paintings such as The Thousand Year Reich (1936). Forbidden to practice his profession, he was arrested twice\u2014briefly in 1936, and again in 1938, after which he was interned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940\u20131944.In 1945 he went to Moscow, where he attended an anti-fascist school. Returning to Berlin in 1946, he became a professor of painting at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In 1957 he published his autobiography, Zwischen Karneval und Aschermittwoch (\"Between Shrovetide carnival and Ash Wednesday\"). He was awarded the Heinrich Mann Prize in 1958, the year of his death in Berlin.",

The documents do mention his association with the New Materiality and revolutionary-proletarian realism movements, but not specifically with the New Objectivity movement."

This can be inferred from the following details:\n\n1. The document at `46.txt` describes Hans Grundig as a \"German painter and graphic artist associated with the New Objectivity movement.\"\n2. Document `58.txt` provides his birth year (1901) and mentions that he was married to another artist, indicating his involvement in artistic circles.\n3. Documents like `44.txt` also mention his graduation from the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and his involvement with other artists, supporting his status as a painter.\n\nTherefore, the triple stating that Hans Grundig is a German painter and graphic artist associated with the New Objectivity movement is supported by the given documents."
