However, there is no information about a \"Half-A-Dollar-Bill\" being released on January 14, 1924. In fact, the Coin Act of September 26, 1890, prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from changing the design of any circulating coin until after its required 25-year \"length of service\" had elapsed, which means that the Franklin half dollar, introduced in 1890, still had more than 15 years left on its original design before it could be changed."
