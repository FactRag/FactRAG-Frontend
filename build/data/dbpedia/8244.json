However, none of them explicitly state that The United States District Court for the District of Oregon was appointed by Barack Obama. In fact, one document mentions Justice Adrienne C. Nelson being confirmed to the U.S. district judge position, but it does not mention the court being directly appointed by Obama. Another document mentions President Obama nominating Judge Marco Hernandez, Beryl A. Howell, and others to seats on the United States District Court, but it does not specify the District of Oregon. Therefore, the information in the documents does not support the triple that The United States District Court for the District of Oregon was appointed by Barack Obama."
