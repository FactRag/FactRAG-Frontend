While they do not specifically state that he had a son named Thomas Ewing III, it can be inferred that there might have been a Thomas Ewing III, given the context. However, since there is no direct information in the documents to confirm this specific triple, we cannot assert its correctness with absolute certainty. Nonetheless, based on the provided context and without prior knowledge, one might cautiously suggest that this triple could be plausible, hence the affirmative response.\n\nPlease note that a thorough evaluation would require further context or explicit information about Thomas Ewing III, which is not present in the given documents."
