It was created in 1953 to succeed its predecessor, the Luchtvaartafdeling (English: aviation department) of the Dutch Army, which was founded in 1913.\" While it does not explicitly mention \"Roundel\" as their identification symbol, the context provided in other documents strongly supports that the Royal Netherlands Air Force uses a roundel. The query is correct based on the inference from the given information."
