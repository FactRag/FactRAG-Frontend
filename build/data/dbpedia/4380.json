Additionally, they mention Martin's contributions to the field of mathematics, including being Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Chair of the Royal Society\u2019s Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education.\n\nGiven this information, I conclude that:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThe triple is correct according to the documents."
