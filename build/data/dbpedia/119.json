Instead of the normative roots of much of the field of finance, it uses a positivist framework including exemplars from statistical physics with an emphasis on emergent or collective properties of financial markets. The starting point for this approach to understanding financial markets are the empirically observed stylized facts.",

For example: \"The main objective of statistical econophysics is to describe the past financial and economic data through the identification of macro-statistical properties implying a phenomenon of emergence.\"\n* **Positive approach with emphasis on emergent properties:** The documents highlight the use of physics tools (statistical mechanics) to understand *how* markets function rather than prescribing *what* they should do.  The emphasis is on collective behavior and emergent properties, aligning with a positivist framework. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other triples you'd like me to evaluate!"

The documents provided contain information on how Econophysics applies ideas from statistical mechanics to financial markets, and how it uses models from statistical physics to analyze and understand financial phenomena.\n\nThis supports the idea that Statistical finance is indeed an application of econophysics to financial markets, rather than relying on normative roots or a positivist framework including exemplars from statistical physics with emphasis on emergent or collective properties."
