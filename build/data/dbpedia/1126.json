For example, the first document mentions that \"The band behind the always mercurial McKee... included Marvin Etzioni on bass, Ryan Hedgecock on guitar and Don Heffington on drums\", but it does not mention anything about the song's release date.\n\nThe second document explicitly states that \"Teenage Kicks was written by guitarist John O'Neill and released in 1978\". This is further confirmed by other documents, such as the fourth document which mentions that \"Teenage Kicks\" will be out on April 4 (no year mentioned) but refers to a double album of late '70s punk tunes.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the subject of \"Teenage Kicks\" indeed refers to songs from 1978."
