For example, one document mentions \"Additional cast: Craig Fairbrass\" without specifying if he's a main character or just an extra. Another document states that Brigitte Nielsen is the lead actress and mentions her co-star Richard Moll as the villain.\n* The documents also provide information about the film's tone, plot, and style, which could be interpreted as supporting the description of Galaxis as an \"abstract action science fiction\" film.\n\nOverall, while there might not be a direct match for all details in the triple, the context information provided does support most of it, making the answer positive."

Though their exact roles are not explicitly detailed, they are mentioned in this context.\n- **Release Year**: \"Galaxis\" is clearly stated to be released in 1995.\n\nThus, the provided information strongly supports the triple given the context of the documents."
