However, they do not provide any information about the volume of the film, which is implied by the query's statement that it is \"no.\" Since there is no relevant information in the provided context to confirm or deny such a claim, and considering the nature of the film (a motion picture), it can be reasonably concluded that the query's assertion does not align with typical discussions about films."
