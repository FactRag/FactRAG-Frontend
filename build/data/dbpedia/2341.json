However, there is no information that suggests Lavin's career ended in 2015. In fact, one document mentions that he held his role as head coach at St. John's for six seasons after being hired in 2010, which would place the end of his tenure at around 2016."

According to the information provided, Steve Lavin had a significant tenure as head coach at St. John\u2019s University from 2010 to 2015 but did not end his coaching career then. The document with file path `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2341/re-ranker-msmarco/75.txt` indicates that the Steve Lavin era at St. John's ended in 2016, as it states \"The Red Storm won 21 games this season and returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2011\" with \"Lavin went 81-53 at the helm before the two parted ways,\" suggesting he was coaching until after the mentioned period. Additionally, there is information about Lavin joining FOX Sports in one of the documents, which further indicates his career did not end in 2015."
