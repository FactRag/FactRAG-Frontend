However, this is not a triple premiership win by him as a player.\n\nThe statement about being a \"triple premiership player\" seems to be an error or a misunderstanding. The correct interpretation of the information in the documents would be that Barry Davis played for three premiership teams, but he did not win three premierships as a player.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
