Asquith was ever the Prime Minister of Bonar Law. In fact, the opposite is true: Bonar Law succeeded David Lloyd George as Prime Minister in 1922."

Asquith, Andrew Bonar Law, and David Lloyd George during World War I. Specifically, they indicate that H.H. Asquith was Prime Minister before and during part of World War I, including his dealings with Bonar Law who supported his government but gradually lost confidence in him as a wartime leader. This context supports the statement that H.H. Asquith was indeed the Prime Minister preceding or during Bonar Law's significant political actions and eventual rise to power."
