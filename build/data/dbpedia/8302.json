There is no mention of him being born in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which was a historical entity that existed from 1801 to 1922 and included Ireland as part of the UK. The documents specifically state \"England, UK\", suggesting that he was born after the dissolution of the UK of Great Britain and Ireland."
