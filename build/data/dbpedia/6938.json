The correct triple seems to be: 'The caption of the film \"Ran\" is [some specific caption]'.\"\n\nGiven the context information and without prior knowledge, let me rephrase the query to identify what is actually being asked.\n\nQuery: What is the caption of the film 'Ran'?\n\nTo answer this question based on the provided documents:\n\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6938/re-ranker-msmarco/17.txt does not mention the caption.\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6938/re-ranker-msmarco/18.txt contains information about \"Ran\" as a film, but it does not specify its theatrical release poster's caption.\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6938/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt contains an expanded essay by Randy Skretvedt (PDF, 308KB) about the film \"The Big Heat,\" not \"Ran.\"\n\nHowever, looking at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6938/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt contains another expanded essay by Keith Phipps (PDF, 375 KB) about the film \"Blackboard Jungle\" and not \"Ran.\" The document does mention that \"The result was 'Blackboard Jungle,' an adaptation of the controversial novel by Evan Hunter about an inner-city schoolteacher...\". But this is information about a different movie.\n\nLooking at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6938/re-ranker-msmarco/18.txt, we can see that there's information about the film \"Ran\" and it says: \"Ran movie poster (Variant Edition) by Huang Hai.  Printed in England by White Duck Editions.\" which seems to be related to a specific edition of a poster for 'Ran', but not necessarily its theatrical release.\n\nUpon reviewing all documents, I still couldn't find an exact match of the query \"The caption of the film 'Ran' is 'Theatrical release poster'\". However, it can be argued that this statement might indeed be true as there are multiple editions and posters for films, including 'Ran'. The information provided does not explicitly confirm or deny whether a specific theatrical release poster exists for the movie 'Ran', so I'll default to \"no\" based on not finding an exact match.\n\nSo my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
