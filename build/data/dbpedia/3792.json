However, there is no direct mention of him being a soldier in general, but rather that he served with Grayson's Additional Continental Regiment (1777) and later became a Lieutenant Colonel. Nevertheless, this specific type of military role (soldier) can be inferred from his military service history, making the triple correct according to the documents."
