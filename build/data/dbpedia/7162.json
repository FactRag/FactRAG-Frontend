Plesset.\"\n\nFrom the given documents, particularly file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7162/re-ranker-msmarco/69.txt and file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7162/re-ranker-msmarco/3.txt, we can see that:\n\n* Andrea Prosperetti is mentioned as a notable scientist who finished their doctoral work under Milton Plesset's guidance.\n* The document does not mention the name of Andrea Prosperetti's doctoral advisor explicitly.\n\nGiven this information, I would say that the triple is partially supported by the documents. While it is true that Andrea Prosperetti worked under Milton Plesset's guidance, it is not stated explicitly that Plesset was their doctoral advisor.\n\nTherefore, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes', 'reason': 'partially_supported'}`\n\nHowever, since you requested a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer in the format specified, I will provide:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
