Another document mentions a person named Alisha Klass who was born in the United States, but it is unclear if this is the same person as Alisha Glass. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot confirm that Alisha Glass was born in the United States.\n\nNote: The documents do mention Alisha Glass's nationality as American, but that does not necessarily mean she was born in the United States (e.g., she could have been born in another country and later became a naturalized American citizen)."
