The document mentions that since 774, when King Silo established his court at Santianes de Pravia, until the reign of Alfonso II, \"it\" (referring to Pravia) \"was the capital of the kingdom of Asturias\", which suggests that it was actually Santianes de Pravia that served as the capital during that time period."

Therefore, if the query implies an ongoing or general status as opposed to a specific period in history, it would be incorrect.\n\nThe answer provided should thus consider this nuance:\n\nAnswer: {'output': 'no'}"
