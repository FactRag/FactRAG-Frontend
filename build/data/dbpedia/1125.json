They mention that Dalhalla is an amphitheatre (or outdoor theatre/open air theatre) located in a former limestone quarry, and it's used as a summer music venue. They also confirm the location (7 km north of Lake Siljan and the town of R\u00e4ttvik in central Sweden), the depth (60m), length (400m), and width (175m) of the quarry, and that the venue has been opened since 1995 with a capacity for 4,000 seats. The only difference is the use of \"Dalecarlia\" instead of \"Dalarna\", but this is not significant enough to make the triple incorrect."
