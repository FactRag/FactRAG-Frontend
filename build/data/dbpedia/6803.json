However, none of the documents explicitly state that Roger Daltrey is a subject of Category:Polydor Records artists.\n\nUpon closer inspection, I notice that some documents do mention Roger Daltrey's association with specific awards and prizes, such as The Brit award, Ivor Novello award, and Nordoff Robbins' award.
