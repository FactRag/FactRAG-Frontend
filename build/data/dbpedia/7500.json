In fact, most of the texts mention that \"Giallo\" refers to a genre of literature and film, which combines elements of mystery, horror, and thriller. Some texts also mention the origins of the term and its association with yellow covers on paperback novels, but there is no indication that it is primarily about Italian words and phrases."

While it mentions that the term \"giallo\" means \"yellow\" in Italian, this alone does not encompass the entire description of what the Giallo genre is about."
