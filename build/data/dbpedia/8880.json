Instead, the documents indicate that during the period when the Beylik of Tunis existed (1705-1881), Tunisia used the French Franc as its official currency after becoming a French protectorate in the late 19th century. The Tunisian Dinar became the official currency only after Tunisia gained independence in 1956, which is several decades after the period of the Beylik of Tunis."
