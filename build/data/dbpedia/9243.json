While it doesn't explicitly say he's from the United States, it implies that he has connections to the country through his birthplace. Additionally, one of the documents mentions that Jarel's medical insurance only covers costs for 11 days in Costa Rica, but there's no indication that he's not a US citizen or resident. Given this information, it's reasonable to infer that Jneiro Jarel is likely from the United States."
