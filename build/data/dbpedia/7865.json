Ausubel being a student of Sharon R. Long in any of the provided documents. However, one document mentions that Sharon Lee Long was a professor at Stanford University and another mentions Frederick M. Ausubel's educational background, but there is no direct connection between them as teacher and student.\n* The only mention of Sharon Long is in relation to her own research work and career achievements, not in any capacity related to Frederick M. Ausubel.\n* Therefore, based on the provided context information, it is not possible to conclude that Frederick M. Ausubel was a notable student of Sharon R. Long, hence the answer \"no\"."
