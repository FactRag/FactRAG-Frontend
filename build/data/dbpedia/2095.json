This can be seen from various sections of the document, such as:\n\n* The description of the campaign as a \"counter-insurgency campaign the People's Liberation Army (PLA) fought against the remaining Nationalist forces in mainland China.\"\n* The mention of PLA commanders and leaders, such as Lin Biao, Liu Bocheng, He Long, and Deng Xiaoping.\n* The contrast with the National Revolutionary Army, which is mentioned separately in another section of the document."
