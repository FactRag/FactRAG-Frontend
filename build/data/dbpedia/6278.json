The genre is not mentioned at all.\n* **Document 3 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6278/re-ranker-msmarco/123.txt)**:\n\t+ This text describes \"Lithium\" (not \"Lithivm\") as a thriller film from Sweden.\n\t+ However, it does not specifically mention \"Lithivm\".\n* **Document 4 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6278/re-ranker-msmarco/102.txt)**:\n\t+ This text also describes \"Lithium\" as a crime thriller from Sweden, but again does not mention \"Lithivm\".\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the information in the documents supports the triple only partially. While they confirm that Lithivm is Swedish and has some connection to film (a movie poster is mentioned), there is no clear indication that it is a thriller film. The connection between Lithivm and Swedish thriller films seems uncertain.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThis means the triple \"Lithivm is about Swedish thriller films\" is not entirely supported by the provided documents."
