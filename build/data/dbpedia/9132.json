Initially, it was under Belgian rule after Germany's occupation, and thus used the Belgian Congo franc from 1916 until the Rwanda and Burundi franc was introduced in the 1960s. The German East African rupie is not mentioned as being the official currency of the Kingdom of Burundi; rather, it refers to a currency used in German East Africa (which included parts of today's Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) between 1890 and 1916."
