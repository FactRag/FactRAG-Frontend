However, the documents also mention Skog as a secluded forest area with an ancient dark spirit (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5648/re-ranker-msmarco/21.txt), and a horror puzzle game called \"Rituals: Book of Skog\" where players trek across Skog performing rites by matching symbols to cleanse an area of evil. This suggests that the genre associated with Skog in this context is more likely to be related to horror or mystery rather than indie folk, but it is still possible that a specific group or band could have been referred to as \"Skog\" and had an indie folk genre."
