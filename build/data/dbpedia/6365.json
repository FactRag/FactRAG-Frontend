Instead, it mentions a film called Calm With Horses and discusses color palettes in filmmaking, but does not specifically relate these topics to Sunday or the film Calm With Horses being about Black-and-white films."

However, another part of the text discusses monochrome (black-and-white) color palettes and how they can be used by filmmakers. While there isn't a direct statement about \"Calm With Horses\" being in black and white, the context implies that the mention of such films is relevant when discussing color palettes, thus supporting the idea that such films exist and can indeed be referred to as black-and-white films."
