Duane Carter (May 5, 1913 \u2013 May 7, 1993) - American race car driver\n2. Duane M. Carter (born December 10, 1954) - African-American trumpet player, composer, arranger, bandleader and writer\n3. Duane Martin Carter (born December 10, 1954) - jazz trumpeteer (same as Duane M. Carter?)\n4. Duane Allen \"Bear\" Carter (passed away July 15, 2012)\n5. Duane Carter - junior sports media relations major\n\nIt is not explicitly stated that any of these individuals have the given name \"Duane\". However, it can be inferred from the documents that at least some of them do.\n\nFor example, in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2487/re-ranker-msmarco/50.txt, we see the phrase \"Duane Carter (May 5, 1913 \u2013 May 7, 1993)\" which suggests that his given name is indeed \"Duane\".\n\nHowever, it cannot be definitively concluded that all instances of Duane Carter refer to the same individual with the given name \"Duane\", especially since there are multiple individuals with similar names.\n\nTherefore, while the triple might be likely correct for some instances of Duane Carter, it cannot be conclusively verified as true based on the provided documents.\n\nThe final answer is: \n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
