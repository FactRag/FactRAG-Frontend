From 1989 to 1993 van Eeden studied painting at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. Van Eeden lives and works in Zurich and The Hague.\"\n\nThe query seems to be asking whether Marcel van Eeden's abstract (which I assume refers to his artistic style or characteristics) is accurately described by the given text.\n\nHere is my evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nMy reasoning is that the provided text does indeed describe Marcel van Eeden as a Dutch draftsman and painter, born in The Hague, Netherlands, with a history of studying painting at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, and living and working in Zurich and The Hague. Additionally, it mentions his characteristic use of film-noir style, black-and-white contrast, and almost photo-realistic depictions, which seems to be consistent with the abstract query.\n\nHowever, I want to note that the abstract query is quite broad and doesn't specify any particular aspect of Marcel van Eeden's work or characteristics. If the query was more specific (e.g., \"Marcel van Eeden's work often features a dark film-noir sensibility...\"), my evaluation might be different.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!"
