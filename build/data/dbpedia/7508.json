In fact, it's mentioned specifically in relation to the time period and geographical location where Mu`awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan and `Ali ibn Abi Talib were in power, which is not directly related to countries or geographical subdivisions outside of that context."

The text discusses Dar ul-Baghi as a subdivision but it is related to areas where the people are implementing Islam and do not have the rule of the khalifah, which contrasts with \"Qeyah Baghi\". Therefore, the statement is unsupported by the provided context."
