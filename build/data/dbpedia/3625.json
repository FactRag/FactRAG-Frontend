However, none of the provided documents mention a prisoner count in this range. The first document mentions that on September 19, 1918, Allenby attacked with a massive and well-supplied army, but it does not provide information about prisoners. The second document discusses Ottoman Prisoners of War taken by the Entente Powers, but it states that the minimum number of captives is 217,746 (and up to 242,746), which is outside the specified range.\n\nOnly the third document mentions the Turkish War of Independence, but it does not provide any information about prisoners."
