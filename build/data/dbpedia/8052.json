In one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8052/re-ranker-msmarco/42.txt), it is mentioned that \"Park Geun-hye is the first female president of South Korea and the first popularly elected head of state in East Asia.\" In another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8052/re-ranker-msmarco/46.txt), it is mentioned that \"Park Geun-hye (Hangul: \ubc15\uadfc\ud61c; RR: Bak Geun(-)hye; IPA: [pak\u203fk\u0348\u026fn.hje]; often in English ; born 2 February 1952) is a South Korean politician who served as the 11th (18th election) president of South Korea from 2013 to 2017...\" These documents support the statement that Park Geun-hye was the leader of South Korea."

The term \"leader\" is vague and could be misleading if interpreted to mean she was the leader at all times. Given the information provided, it\u2019s more accurate to state her specific role as president from 2013 to 2017."
