The information provided mentions a 1953 film with the same title, but it does not specify what kind of films it is (e.g., English-language films). Therefore, the triple \"The subject of the film 'Forces' Sweetheart' is English-language films\" cannot be confirmed by the documents as correct or incorrect.
