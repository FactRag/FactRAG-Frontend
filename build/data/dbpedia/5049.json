Therefore, the alignment with the concept of \"left\" seems to be incorrect, as left-hand traffic is only practiced by around 33.9% of the world's population.\n\nThe context information does mention that left-hand traffic has historical roots and was more common worldwide in the past, but it does not suggest that right and left-hand traffic aligns with the concept of \"left\"."
