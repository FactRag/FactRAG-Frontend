The country where this event took place is indeed the United States. There is no contradiction or evidence to suggest otherwise in the provided context. Therefore, the triple is supported by the information in the documents."

However, it does not explicitly state that \"Stolen Honor\" is set or made specifically about the United States, only that it involves U.S. Presidential candidate John Kerry and Vietnam War events. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer but not directly confirm the country as the United States without additional information. Given the query focuses on the setting of the film rather than its production, the inference is reasonable and thus supports the triple \"The country of Stolen Honor is the United States.\""
