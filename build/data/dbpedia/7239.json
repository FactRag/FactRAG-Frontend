However, one document does describe the early silent film era of Hollywood as having used film language and shot existing stageworks.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the answer to whether the documents support the triple \"The subject of the 1915 film Madame Butterfly is Black-and-white films\" is:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"

While they do not explicitly state that it was a black-and-white film, the context of being from the early silent film era (around 1915) strongly implies that it would have been in black and white. Therefore, based on the documents provided, the statement can be considered supported with the assumption that all films before color technology became widespread were indeed in black and white."
