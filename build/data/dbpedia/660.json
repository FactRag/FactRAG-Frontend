The first document mentions \"The Westfield Heritage Centre\" and its location, but it doesn't specify that it's in Canada. It actually mentions being \"just west of Rockton, Ontario\", which implies a specific region within Canada.\n2. The second document confirms that the Westfield Heritage Centre is located near Rockton, Ontario, but again, it doesn't explicitly state that it's in Canada as a whole.\n3. However, the third and fourth documents (which seem to be duplicates) mention \"Hamilton, Ontario\" and \"Rockton, ON L0R 1X0\", respectively. Both of these mentions imply that the Westfield Heritage Centre is located within the province of Ontario, which is part of Canada.\n\nBased on this analysis, while the specific triple statement (\"The Westfield Heritage Centre is located in Canada\") is true, it's not entirely explicit in all the documents provided. However, given the context and assuming the intent was to determine if it's in Canada (which includes Ontario), I would conclude that the information supports the triple.\n\nTherefore, the response is:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
