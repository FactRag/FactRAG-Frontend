Here is the evaluation:\n\n* The documents consistently state that Mike Brewer is a British car trader turned presenter of motoring television programmes.\n* The documents mention Wheeler Dealers as one of his current or past shows, both with Edd China (in some cases) and Marc \"Elvis\" Priestley (in one case).\n* The documents also list other shows he has presented, including Driven, Deals on Wheels, Pulling Power, Wrecks To Riches, Auto Trader.\n* Revved Up is mentioned as a show in which Mike Brewer presents coverage of the British Rally Championship.\n\nHowever, there are some inconsistencies and missing information:\n* Remote Madness is not mentioned anywhere in the provided context information.\n* Frontline Battle Machines is indeed mentioned in one document (from 2010), but it does not specify that Mike Brewer was the presenter; instead, he \"fronted\" the series.\n* The documents do not provide any direct evidence of Edd China being his current co-host on Wheeler Dealers, as some mention Marc \"Elvis\" Priestley or Ant Anstead in this role.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\nThe answer is:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThe triple is generally supported by the context information provided. However, there are some inconsistencies and missing details regarding his co-hosts on Wheeler Dealers and another show (Remote Madness)."
