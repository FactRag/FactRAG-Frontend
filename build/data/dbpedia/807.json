The documents mention Callie Khouri as the creator, writer, and producer of the country music drama Nashville, which suggests that she wrote at least some of the content in season 1."

Therefore, the statement that Dana Greenblatt wrote episodes of \"Nashville\" (season 1 or any season) is supported by the provided information. However, it should be noted that the documents do not specify which exact season(s) she wrote for, only that she has contributed to writing episodes of the show."
