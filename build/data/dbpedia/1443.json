Haggott, and it is clear from the content that he is mentioned in the context of being the Lieutenant Governor of Colorado (as indicated by the title \"The proclamation follows: State of Colorado, Executive Chamber, Denver.\u2014Proclamation.\" which suggests a government document related to the state of Colorado)."
