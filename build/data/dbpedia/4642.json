In a bit of irony, the opening track \u201cStop!\u201d starts abruptly as a solid rocker throughout.\" However, there is no mention of MCA Records.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4642/re-ranker-msmarco/23.txt, it is mentioned that \"Future albums rose to number 2 on the same charts and their popularity grew through the decade.\" However, there is no mention of The Clarks being signed with MCA Records.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4642/re-ranker-msmarco/76.txt, it is mentioned that \"They were on their own label while making their first albums and then MCA took notice. They signed with them in 1996 but MCA started to pay more attention to their label mate Blink \u2013 182 and didn\u2019t push The Clarks.\" This suggests that The Clarks were signed with MCA Records, but the label did not promote them as much as they promoted Blink-182.\n\nHowever, I also found that:\n\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4642/re-ranker-msmarco/76.txt, it is mentioned that \"They signed with Razor & Tie after MCA and achieved success locally but not nationally.\" This suggests that The Clarks were indeed signed with MCA Records at some point.\n\nConsidering the information provided in all documents, I conclude that:\n\n`{ 'output': 'yes' }`\n\nThe Clarks are labeled or signed with MCA Records, although they later left the label."
