Willie\u2019s only all-gospel album was a big hit; now, this long-out-of-print gem is back on vinyl.

Produced by Arif Mardin, the album was recorded in two days at the Atlantic Records studio in New York City in February 1973.\"\n* Document 5 mentions \"Original Release Date: 1976\" but this appears to be a re-release date.\n* Document 6 is identical to document 4 and also has information about the original release date being 1973.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that the album \"The Troublemaker\" was indeed released in 1976, but not as an initial release. The correct release date mentioned in multiple documents is February 1973, but there are mentions of a re-release or re-mastering on September 28, 2018.\n\nTherefore:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'no'}"
