However, later documents mention her birthplace as Ireland (without specifying Galway). Therefore, the triple \"Aoife Mulholland was born in Galway\" cannot be definitively confirmed or denied based on the provided context information."

While it doesn't explicitly state she was born there, her origin from Galway strongly supports the inference that she was indeed born in or near Galway, as is common for people who are from a specific place."
