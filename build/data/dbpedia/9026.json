However, none of these mentions directly state that she was born or grew up in a specific country within the United States (e.g., Missouri is mentioned as her birthplace).\n\nHowever, one of the documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9026/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt) mentions that Maya Angelou grew up in Stamps, Arkansas, and experienced racial discrimination in the American South. This implies that she spent her childhood in the United States.\n\nTherefore, based on this indirect evidence, I will provide a response that is \"yes\", but with a note that it's not a direct statement from the documents:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'maybe'}"

Although it does not explicitly state that her hometown is the U.S., given her work and involvement with organizations based in the U.S., we can infer that she has a connection to the country. Therefore, the statement \"Maya Ford's hometown is United States\" aligns with the provided context information."
