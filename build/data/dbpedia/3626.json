In fact, one of the documents mentions him as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Occupation during the Chanak incident, but it does not specify whether he was involved in the Turkish War of Independence. However, since there is no information to support this claim, we can conclude that the triple is incorrect."

However, he did command Allied Occupation Forces in Turkey during a period which overlaps with the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), and his role might be considered indirectly related to this conflict. Since the direct involvement or title as \"commander\" specifically for the Turkish War of Independence is not mentioned, we cannot confirm this from the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis response acknowledges that while Harington had significant military roles in Turkey during a relevant time period, there is insufficient evidence to conclude he was specifically a commander in the Turkish War of Independence as stated."
