However, there is no information that suggests Bratislava was not the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary during this time.\n* The relevant text is: \"Between 1536 and 1783, Bratislava, known by its German name of Pressburg, was the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary.\"\n* Therefore, based on the provided documents, it appears that Bratislava was indeed the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary during this period."

After this period, Budapest became the official capital of Hungary.\n\nSince the query does not specify a time frame and typically \"capital\" refers to an ongoing political status rather than just a historic one, we need to consider whether Bratislava remains the capital of Kingdom of Hungary currently or in general without specifying the timeframe.\n\nGiven that Bratislava is now the capital of Slovakia since its independence from Czechoslovakia in 1993 and not part of the current Kingdom of Hungary (as there isn't a modern-day \"Kingdom\" of Hungary but rather the Hungarian Republic), we conclude that while historically true for a specific period, this statement does not apply currently or without qualification.\n\nTherefore, the correct output is:\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis indicates that unless specified in the context (which it isn't) about the historical time frame of 1536 to 1783, Bratislava cannot be considered as the capital of Kingdom of Hungary currently or generally."
