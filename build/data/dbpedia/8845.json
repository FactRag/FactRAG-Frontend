Several of them explicitly state that Beirut is the capital city of Lebanon. \n\n* **Implication:** While the term \"Greater Lebanon\" isn't used consistently,  the documents imply that Beirut serves as a center for a larger metropolitan area.\n\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the triple \"The capital of Greater Lebanon is Beirut\" is supported."
