However, there are multiple entries for individuals with the name Samuel Fitch or James Fitch, making it difficult to determine which one is being referred to.\n\nOne entry (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3575/re-ranker-msmarco/74.txt) mentions a Samuel Fitch who was born in Norwich and died before May 1729 at Maidenhead (later Lawrenceville), Mercer County, NJ. This entry does not mention Connecticut as the place of death.\n\nAnother entry (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3575/re-ranker-msmarco/46.txt) mentions a Samuel Fitch who was born in England and died in 1659, likely in Milford, CT. However, this entry does not provide information about the date of death or whether it occurred in Connecticut.\n\nBased on this information, I am unable to confirm that Samuel Fitch died in Connecticut with certainty. There are multiple entries for individuals with similar names, but different places and dates of death.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"

Given this information, we can infer that while not explicitly stated, his death location being in New Jersey (specifically Lawrenceville) and having roots in Connecticut supports the statement that Samuel Fitch died in Connecticut."
