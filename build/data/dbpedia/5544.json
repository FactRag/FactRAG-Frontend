According to one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5544/re-ranker-msmarco/51.txt), Kirk's term as Senator from Illinois (R) was from 29 November 2010 to 3 January 2017, which means that his term ended on January 3, 2017, not November 29, 2010."

This indicates his term began on 29 November 2010, not ended on this date. Therefore, the statement \"Mark Kirk's term ended on November 29, 2010\" is incorrect according to the given context information."
