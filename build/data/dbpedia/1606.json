(e.g., file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1606/re-ranker-msmarco/107.txt, file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1606/re-ranker-msmarco/66.txt)\n* In one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1606/re-ranker-msmarco/87.txt), the southern lights are referred to as \"aurora australis\" or \"southern lights\", but not as simply \"Southern Aurora\".\n* There is no specific information that contradicts the statement \"Southern Aurora is named 'Southern Aurora'\", but it's worth noting that the term \"Aurora australis\" is more commonly used in the context.\n\nBased on this analysis, my answer would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`\n\nHowever, I want to emphasize that this evaluation might not be perfect without further context or information.
