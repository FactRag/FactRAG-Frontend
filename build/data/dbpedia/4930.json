Specifically, document #48 mentions \"born in June 1965 in Washington, D.C.\" but this is contradicted by document #134 which simply states \"Adam Smith was born in June 1965\" without specifying the city of birth. Additionally, documents #58 and others mention Adam Smith's adoption and upbringing in SeaTac, Washington, but do not provide explicit information about his birthplace.\n\nTherefore, while there are hints and suggestions in various documents that might support the triple, they are not sufficient to confirm it as universally true."
