McGuffey House as a historic house museum located at 401 East Spring Street, within the campus of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, United States. It mentions that the house is believed to be the place where William Holmes McGuffey wrote the first four of the McGuffey Readers, but it does not mention education museums specifically.\n\nWhile the McGuffey House and Museum do offer educational programs and tours, the primary focus appears to be on preserving the history of William Holmes McGuffey and the Miami University campus, rather than solely on education museums in the United States."

Therefore, it supports the statement that the subject of the William H. McGuffey House is Education museums in the United States."
