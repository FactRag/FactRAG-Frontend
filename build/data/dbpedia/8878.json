This suggests that while the label might be unofficial, it still bears Frank Zappa's name.\n\nTherefore, considering this information, I would say that the statement \"The label of Frank Zappa is Frank Zappa\" is not entirely supported by the documents. However, since one of the files does mention a record with Frank Zappa's name as the artist and an unofficial label, I will answer:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"

This supports the triple that the label of Frank Zappa is Frank Zappa."
