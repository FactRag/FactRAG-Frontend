While one of the documents mentions that The Trusts Arena has played host to ANZ Premiership netball games, this is only a single instance and does not suggest that netball is the primary or exclusive focus of the arena.\n\nAdditionally, another document explicitly states that \"The Trusts events cater to a wide array of tastes. It's not just about the mainstream; it's about diversity\", which implies that the arena hosts various types of events beyond sports.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it is incorrect to conclude that The Trusts Arena is primarily or exclusively a venue for netball in New Zealand."
