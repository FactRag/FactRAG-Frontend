This implies that during some time in the late 20th century, the city's official name changed, but I couldn't find any information suggesting that this change occurred in 1992 specifically.\n\nHowever, according to other documents, from 1946 to 1992, Podgorica was indeed called Titograd, and after 1992, it went back to being called Podgorica. This suggests that during the period of 1992-2006, the city was still officially named Podgorica.\n\nSo, I should have answered \"yes\", not \"no\". Thank you for pointing out the error!\n\nCorrected answer:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"

Specifically, multiple documents mention that Podgorica has been the capital city of Montenegro since 1992 (after it was renamed from Titograd in 1992) and remains so even after Montenegro gained independence in 2006."
