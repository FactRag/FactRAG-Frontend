While the exact term \"AM-Mark\" is not explicitly mentioned, the context strongly supports that the currency referred to as AMC was indeed a form of occupation currency, such as the AM-mark described. Therefore, the statement that the currency of Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories is AM-Mark is supported by the provided documents."
