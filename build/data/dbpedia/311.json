The documents do mention that the film was made by a French director (Raul Ruiz) and that it was produced in France, but they also mention other details about the film, such as its influences and themes, which suggest that it is not solely about French films."

However, none of the provided texts explicitly state that the subject or primary focus of the film is French films. Instead, it discusses how the film draws inspiration from literature and other cinematic works but does not specify the nationality of these sources as being exclusive to France."
