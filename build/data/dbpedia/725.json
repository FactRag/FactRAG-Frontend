Bendus in a Neoclassical style.\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_725/re-ranker-msmarco/5.txt). This supports the statement that it's a historical building, but contradicts the opening year of 1924.\n* The document mentions that \"The Jerusalem Temple Lodge No. 90 Masonic body was formed in October 1850\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_725/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt) and \"They first met in the Main Street Building until moving into a Masonic Hall on Fox Street in 1866.\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_725/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt). This suggests that there were previous meeting locations, but does not contradict the statement about Freemasons holding meetings.\n* The document mentions that \"The Masonic Temple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_725/re-ranker-msmarco/52.txt).

The discrepancy between 1922 (documented construction date) and 1924 (stated in the query) does not invalidate the overall accuracy of the description.\n- **National Register:** The documents indicate that the Masonic Temple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, confirming its addition to this register.\n\nGiven these points, while there are minor discrepancies like the exact opening year, the core elements of the statement are supported by the provided context."
