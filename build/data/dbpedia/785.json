However, while they mention her birthplace as Limlingerode, Prussian Saxony (in some cases), this place name is only explicitly mentioned in the documents related to Sarah Kirsch's biography, which means we can infer that she was born somewhere within the broader geographical area of what is now modern-day Germany, but not necessarily \"Prussian Saxony\" (the Kingdom of Prussia dissolved after World War I)."
