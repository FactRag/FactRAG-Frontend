However, later documents mention controversies surrounding the school's teaching of creationism and its refusal to allow students to use religious materials in their studies, which suggests that the school may have a more specific or conservative Christian agenda than simply being non-denominational.\n\nIn particular, document 49.txt mentions that Blue Ridge has prohibited parents from purchasing or using any curricular materials with a \"religious affiliation\", which implies that the school's values and curriculum are more specifically aligned with a certain form of Christianity. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to describe the denomination of Blue Ridge Christian Academy as simply non-denominational."
