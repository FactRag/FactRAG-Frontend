Specifically, it is mentioned that Ray Brassier is strongly critical of much of contemporary philosophy for attempting to stave off the threat of nihilism, and that he aims to \"push nihilism to its ultimate conclusion\". This suggests that nihilism is indeed one of his main areas of interest.\n\nAdditionally, other speculative realist thinkers, such as Grant, Harman, and Meillassoux, are mentioned in relation to their views on various philosophical topics, with Brassier being compared to them. This implies a shared focus or concern with similar ideas among these philosophers, further supporting the notion that nihilism is a central interest of Ray Brassier's."

This can be inferred from several passages, such as the description of his work aiming to \u201cpush nihilism to its ultimate conclusion\u201d and his strong critique of philosophers who attempt to stave off the threat of nihilism by safeguarding meaning in an enlightened world."
