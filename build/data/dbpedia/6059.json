It also talks about the performances of the two stars.\n* Document 101.txt does not mention anything related to \"Lily in Love\", but rather talks about a celebrity couple, Jack and Lily.\n* Documents 109.txt, 99.txt, and 75.txt do not mention \"Lily in Love\" at all. They discuss different celebrities and projects.\n\nGiven this information, I would conclude that the documents provide some context about actors, but they specifically relate to other projects or individuals, not directly to \"Lily in Love\". However, since there is a connection between actors in one of the mentioned documents (34.txt), I'll evaluate the triple as follows:\n\n* The subject \"Lily in Love\" is indeed about actors.\n* There are no specific details provided that contradict this claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available and without prior knowledge, the answer to the query is:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
