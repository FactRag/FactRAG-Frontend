However, I will provide an answer based on whether the information generally supports the statement.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThis response might seem counterintuitive given the nuances mentioned above; however, it reflects that while there are specific development plans and agreements in place, the project was indeed originally planned."
