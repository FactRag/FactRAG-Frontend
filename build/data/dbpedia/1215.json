The song \"Day 1\" is mentioned in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1215/re-ranker-msmarco/39.txt as being produced by Bink Dawg, but there's no mention of an album called \"A Nu Day\".\n\nTherefore, I would say that the information in the documents does not directly support the triple.\n\nResponse: {'output': 'no'}"
