According to the documents, Andrew Jackson Montague was the Democratic Governor of Virginia from 1 January 1902 to 1 February 1906 (succeeding James Hoge Tyler and preceding Claude A. Swanson). This suggests that James Hoge Tyler was a predecessor of Andrew Jackson Montague, not a governor after him."
