While this doesn't definitively establish that Todd Whitener's hometown is United States without additional context, it strongly suggests he resides in the U.S., and Florida is part of the United States. Given the documents' focus on a person named Todd Whitener who appears to be involved in music and teaching, and considering Middleburg, Florida as his potential residence, we can reasonably infer that Todd Whitener's hometown is indeed within the United States."
