However, there are other individuals named Edward Parkes mentioned with different birth years (e.g., Edward Parkes born in 1890 and another Edward Parkes born in 1893). The statement \"Edward Parkes was born in 1926\" is not specific enough to determine which of the individuals it refers to, but if we assume it's referring to Sir Edward Walter Parkes specifically, then it would be correct. However, without this specificity, and considering there are other Edward Parkes with different birth years mentioned, the general statement is too broad and could lead to confusion or inaccuracy. Thus, based on the given information alone, the answer should be \"no\"."
