This file states that \"The 108 min. film was produced by Film4 Productions and distributed internationally by Universal Pictures.\" However, another file (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4664/re-ranker-msmarco/53.txt) mentions A24 as the distributor of Ex Machina in the semi-wide release. Therefore, it's not entirely accurate to say that the film was distributed by Universal Studios only, which would be a more specific claim than what is actually supported by the documents."
