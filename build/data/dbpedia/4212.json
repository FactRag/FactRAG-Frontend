The documents mention that the book explores the history, iconography, and legal contexts of Chinese tortures and executions, but this is more specific than just stating that it's about the history of imperial China. Additionally, one document mentions that the authors also investigate \"oriental\" tortures in the Western imagination, which suggests a broader scope beyond just imperial China."
