But unlike most idol dramas, no one gets kidnapped (aside from the initial babynapping), no one gets rain flu (a must in romantic dramas), and no one gets amnesia from an impossible explosion. There is however, weird imagination scenes, over acting and crazy weird effects that pull you out of the scene but are actually pretty funny when you get used to them. It\u2019s not the best drama you will ever see and the storyline is nothing new nor involved but it is what it is and it\u2019s not a bad way to waste 13 hours.\"\n\nSince the text describes \"Romantic Princess\" as a \"drama\", and dramas are often presented through television broadcasts, we can infer that it's a type of telecast. \n"
