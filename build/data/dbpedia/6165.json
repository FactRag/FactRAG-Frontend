This suggests that Mary Lyons was not actually associated with PRTM after its acquisition by PwC in 2011.\n\nWhile the documents do mention Mary Lyons as being involved with Maine Pointe (a different company) and working on their global people and talent agenda, there is no information about her role at PRTM being Chief Talent Officer."
