In fact, one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3162/re-ranker-msmarco/45.txt) mentions that Game Center app was removed from iOS and can be accessed through Settings instead. Another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3162/re-ranker-msmarco/149.txt) explains how to use Google Stadia, which is a separate service. Therefore, the information in the documents does not support that Game Center is included in the service of iPad Air."
