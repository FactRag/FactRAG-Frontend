The most sought-out records in Man\u2019s Ruin catalogue were those by Desert Sessions, a loose musical collective founded by Josh Homme from Queens Of The Stone Age / Kyuss...\"\n\nThis information directly links Josh Homme to Man's Ruin Records as a label he was associated with through his involvement with the Desert Sessions band."
