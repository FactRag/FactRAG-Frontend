The documents also describe his work as being inspired by contemporary life, and mention specific years such as 1975, 1978, and 2022. However, there is no explicit statement about the subject of his work being related to 1957 births. Nevertheless, based on the provided context information, it can be inferred that the triple is correct because Robert Lepage's birth year (1957) is repeatedly mentioned across various files, which indirectly supports the idea that \"The subject of Robert Lepage's work is 1957 births\"."
