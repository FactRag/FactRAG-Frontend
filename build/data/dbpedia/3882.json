However, none of them are explicitly stated to be from Germany and released in 1999.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\n* There's a film titled \"The Reef (2006)\" which was released by Warner Bros. UK, but no specific release year is mentioned for the German market.\n* Another document mentions a cancelled project for an animated film titled \"The Reef\" produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation in 1989-1997, with Universal Pictures as distributors. Again, no Germany-specific information.\n* A horror adventure film titled \"The Reef\" (2010) is mentioned, directed and written by Andrew Traucki, but no mention of the country or year of release for a German market.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
