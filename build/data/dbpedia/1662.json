She won the women\u2019s doubles title and reached the singles final at Wimbledon. She played in Wightman Cup competition for the United Kingdom in 1954, 1955, and 1956...\"\n\nHowever, this statement does not explicitly mention her rank at the 1956 French Championships. But we can find it later:\n\n\"...The following year, in 1956, [Angela Mortimer] was the runner up in the women\u2019s singles in France and a quarter finalist again at Wimbledon.\"\n\nThis implies that Angela Mortimer's rank in the women's singles at the 1956 French Championships was indeed 9.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{'output': 'yes'}"
