Several documents mention that Paul Kurtz carried a copy of Plato's *The Republic* during World War II and studied philosophy under the influence of thinkers like Socrates, Marx, John Dewey, and William James. While these don't explicitly state Plato as an influence, the fact that he read Plato heavily suggests Kurt's philosophical development was influenced by him. \n"

This indicates his early exposure and likely influence from Plato's works. Additionally, he studied philosophy under influential figures such as Sidney Hook, Socrates, Marx, John Dewey, and William James, further suggesting his deep engagement with philosophical traditions that include Plato\u2019s thought."
