However, later in the context information, it is mentioned that \"Gaetani was born in Palermo, and held public office there. He was senator of the city in 1775\u201376.\" This implies that Gaetani could have been alive during the time when Francesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani's death would be relevant (i.e., 1798-1832), making it unlikely to be him who died in 1802, as his death would have occurred before the events described.",
