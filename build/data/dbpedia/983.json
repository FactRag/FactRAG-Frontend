The closest match is 1892-1918, which covers part of the specified period but not exactly. \n\nIf you'd like to be more precise, we could say that while Thomas Lough was indeed a UK MP from 1892 until 1918, there is no specific mention of his tenure being limited to 1892-95.\n\nStill, considering the broader context and the fact that he did hold this position for a significant part of the specified period, I would still lean towards a positive response."
