In fact, the context suggests that \"Diardi\" might be a nickname, abbreviation, or reference to a specific aspect of the technology developed by Scala. Therefore, without further information, it's unclear whether \"Diardi\" is the actual name of the entity, and I conclude that the statement \"Diardi's name is Diardi\" is not supported by the documents provided."
