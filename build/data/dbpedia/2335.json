Here's my response:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n\nThe reason for this answer is that the documents mention multiple battles with the name \"Battle of Pancorbo\", but none of them took place in 1808 or at Durango, Biscay. One battle occurred in 816 between a Moorish army and pro-Frankish forces, while another was fought on October 31, 1808, during the Peninsular War, but it did not take place at Durango, Biscay. The documents suggest that there were multiple battles with this name, making the triple statement incorrect according to the provided context information."
