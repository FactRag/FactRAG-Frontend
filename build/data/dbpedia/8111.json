Some of them mention \"West Germany\" (document 2), while others mention \"Great Britain\" (document 3) or do not specify a country at all (document 1). Only one document mentions England specifically as DJ Sharkey's country of origin (document 6), but it is also consistent with other documents that mention Great Britain or the UK.
