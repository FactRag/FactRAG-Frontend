There is no direct mention of a \"Battle of the Mediterranean\" as a specific event or campaign, but the context suggests that the Battle of the Espero Convoy was indeed part of the broader conflict in the Mediterranean region during World War II. Therefore, based on this interpretation, the triple statement is supported by the information provided."
