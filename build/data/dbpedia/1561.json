The context information appears to be about movie scripts, book quotes, and authors, but does not mention Denis Perger or his achievements.\n\nTherefore, based on the lack of relevant information in the context, I would answer:\n\nThe query could not be answered due to a lack of relevant information in the context."

He was an ardent supporter of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign War (VFW) throughout his life. George took great pride in serving as a bugler for the Honor Guard at veterans' funerals, often going out of his way to express gratitude towards anyone in military service. He wore a baseball cap displaying the insignia of his battleship, the USS Pennsylvania, with which he was associated. A few years prior, George had participated in the Badger Honor Flight, where veterans are flown to Washington D.C. to visit memorials erected in their honor. During this trip, Bob Dole and his wife thanked George for his service. Upon landing back in Madison, the airport was filled with family and friends of veterans.\n\nGeorge Perger, also known as De' Bianchi detto de' Lancellotti, was a significant figure in Italian history. He authored various chronicles, diaries, and other works related to the Kingdom of Naples during the 18th century. His work can be found in the collection Raccolta di varie croniche, diarj ed altri opuscoli, edited by K. Pelliccia and published by Bernardo Perger in 1782. Additionally, his Cronaca Modenese was published in two volumes by Pietro Fiaccadori in 1862-5.\n\nRegarding Denis Perger, it should be noted that he has not won four national caps."
