The text mentions that Stratovarius has been labelled as a pioneer of the power metal genre (document 19.txt), and that they are considered one of the leading and most influential groups of the power metal genre (document 48.txt). Additionally, the text describes their distinctive sound as having fast-paced guitar riffs, soaring vocals, and symphonic elements that generate a sense of grandeur and epicness, which is typical of power metal music (document 19.txt).\n\nTherefore, the information in the documents supports the triple that Stratovarius' genre is Power metal."
