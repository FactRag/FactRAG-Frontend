The text mentions that Darlington Borough Council is a local authority for the town of Darlington and the surrounding villages, which implies that it is responsible for billing and other administrative tasks related to those areas. Additionally, one of the documents mentions ordering searches on the NLIS website, which suggests that the council may be involved in billing or other financial matters related to property transactions. Therefore, based on this information, it appears that Darlington Borough Council is indeed about billing authorities in England."
