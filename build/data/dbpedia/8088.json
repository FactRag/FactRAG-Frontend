Specifically, it is stated in document 9.txt that \"Ameritech was created out of the 1984 divestiture AT&T, and was one of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies that was created following the breakup of the Bell System.\"\n\nAdditionally, document 5.txt states that \"Prior to the reorganization, Ohio Bell was a subsidiary of AT & T. Following the reorganization, Ameritech was formed as one of seven new regional telephone companies... Ohio Bell became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameritech.\"\n\nBased on this information, it can be inferred that Ameritech is indeed a parent company of Ohio Bell, and not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}"
