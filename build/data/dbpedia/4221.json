However, it does not provide information about the total number of destroyers.\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4221/re-ranker-msmarco/25.txt mentions that \"the Italian force consisted of two battleships, one cruiser and seven destroyers\" but it's not related to Operation Harpoon.\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4221/re-ranker-msmarco/103.txt mentions that \"the Harpoon convoy was escorted by Force X, the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Cairo, nine destroyers...\" which suggests that there are at least 9 destroyers involved in Operation Harpoon.\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4221/re-ranker-msmarco/149.txt mentions that \"one force consisted of two battleships, one cruiser and seven destroyers\" but it's not related to Operation Harpoon.\n\nHowever, the document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4221/re-ranker-msmarco/103.txt also mentions that \"the convoy was escorted by Force X, the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Cairo, nine destroyers...\" which is related to Operation Harpoon.\n\nTherefore, according to the documents, there are at least 9 destroyers involved in Operation Harpoon, not 17.
