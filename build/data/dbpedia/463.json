Specifically, one document mentions Oscar Einar Steen as a Swedish ice hockey forward, another document talks about Oskar Steen playing for F\u00e4rjestad BK in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL), and another document describes Calle Erik Ste\u00e9n as a Swedish former professional ice hockey player. These references support the triple that Oscar Steen is described as a Swedish ice hockey player."
