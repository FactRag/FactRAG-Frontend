It was released through 2 Tone Records\" which further supports the statement.\n* The document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2128/re-ranker-msmarco/42.txt mentions that \"Madness were invited to cut their first single The Prince/Madness: their first hit\" and it was released on 2 Tone Records, which reinforces the statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided, the answer is affirmative."
