The series is also described as \"the definitive look at the diversity of our planet\" and covers various different types of wildlife habitats on Earth. These descriptions suggest that the subject of the Planet Earth TV series is indeed related to Category: Nature educational television series.\n\nNote: There are some minor discrepancies in the documents regarding the exact co-production credits, broadcast dates, etc., but they do not affect the overall categorization of the series as a nature documentary."
