Specifically:\n\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2427/re-ranker-msmarco/17.txt, there is a mention of Rupert De la Bere being the chief guest at an event in Pershore in 1950.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2427/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt, there is a mention of Rupert De la B\u00e8re sponsoring Herbert's Matrimonial Causes Bill, but the specific year is not mentioned.\n\nHowever, there is also a mention in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2427/re-ranker-msmarco/6.txt that Sir Rupert de la Bere (or B\u00f4re) had acquired plates LM 1 and LM 2 to mark his appointment as Lord Mayor of London in 1964. \n\nTherefore, while there is some evidence to suggest that Rupert De la B\u00e8re was active in the 1950s, it is not clear if he was specifically active in 1950.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the answer would be:\n\n`{'output': 'maybe'}`\n\nHowever, since you asked for a response in the format of \"yes\" or \"no\", and given that there is some evidence to suggest that Rupert De la B\u00e8re was indeed active around 1950, I will provide a more cautious response.\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`\n\nPlease note that this answer should be taken with caution, as it is not entirely clear if the statement is definitively supported by the documents."

He was serving as an Assistant Commissioner in command of the police in Kowloon and the New Territories, Hong Kong when he and two other police chiefs were ambushed at the roadside by 'a Chinese bandit'. The Journal stated that he was a former head boy of Worcester King's School and was the son of Mr E. Luscumbe of Malvern Link. He had survived the capture of Hong Kong by the Japanese and internment during the war.\" These snippets suggest that individuals named Rupert De la Bere or someone with a similar name were active in 1950, supporting the statement that \"Rupert de la B\u00e8re was active in the years 1950.\""
