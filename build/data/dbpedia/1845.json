The first three documents mention General Sir John Doyle, who was an officer in the British Army, but not specifically related to the RAF. The last two documents mention different individuals with the name John Doyle, including one who was a pilot credited with 9 confirmed victories during World War I, but it is clear that this individual is distinct from General Sir John Doyle and does not mention service in the British Army. Therefore, based on the provided context information, the triple \"John Doyle (RAF officer) served in the British Army\" is incorrect."

However, it specifically mentions his service during the American War of Independence and later raising his own regiment for the French Revolutionary Wars. While the provided information does not explicitly state he served directly in the British Army after transferring to the RAF (as in the Pat Frank example), it does confirm that John Doyle was initially an officer in the British Army, which aligns with the query's assertion of him serving there as an RAF officer, albeit indirectly through his initial service."

In file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1845/re-ranker-msmarco/92.txt, there is a reference to John Edgcumbe Doyle DFC (born 18 April 1895) who was a British World War I pilot credited with 9 confirmed victories. However, the documents also clearly state that another John Doyle served in the army starting from March 1771 and distinguishing himself during the American War of Independence, which would include service in the British Army.\n\nGiven these references, it's reasonable to conclude based on the information available that there is a John Doyle who indeed served in the British Army. Therefore, the answer is \"yes\"."
