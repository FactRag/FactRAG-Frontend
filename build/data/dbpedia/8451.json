Here's my evaluation:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n\nThe reason for this answer is that in the provided text, there are several mentions of Zarangush as a village in Iran, with specific details such as its location (in Hendmini Rural District, Badreh District, Darreh Shahr County, Ilam Province), population (1,605 at the 2006 census), and time zone (IRST, UTC+3:30).
