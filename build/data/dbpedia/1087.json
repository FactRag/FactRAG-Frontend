However, there is no mention of his surname in this document.\n* The second file_path (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1087/re-ranker-msmarco/32.txt) contains information about the surname Martinez-Perez, but it does not specifically mention Sandy Mart\u00ednez. Similarly, the third file_path (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1087/re-ranker-msmarco/55.txt) contains information about the surname Martinez-Ruiz, again without mentioning Sandy Mart\u00ednez.\n* However, upon closer inspection of the documents, I notice that Sandy Mart\u00ednez is mentioned in the context of his father, former Major League catcher Sandy Mart\u00ednez, who is also a Martinez.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, I can conclude that:\n\n{ \"output\": \"yes\" }"
