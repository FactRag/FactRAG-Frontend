The document at path `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6587/re-ranker-msmarco/40.txt` states \"Walter Samuel Turner was born at Gestingthorpe, Essex, on January 13th, 1842,\" and another document at path `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6587/re-ranker-msmarco/38.txt` mentions Walter Martin FitzHerbert Turner who was born in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India. Therefore, the statement that \"Walter Turner was born in India\" cannot be universally supported as true based on the given documents, since there is at least one Walter Turner (Walter Samuel) whose birthplace is clearly stated to be Essex, England."
