This suggests that the film is about American investigations involving the character of Charlie Chan, but it does not explicitly state that the film itself is about American films.\n\nHowever, later documents mention that there are scripts for lost Charlie Chan films available on a website, which includes a script for Charlie Chan's Chance (1932). Another document mentions a review of a book called \"Charlie Chan \u2014 The Untold Story of the Honorable Detective and his Rendezvous with American History\", written by Yunte Huang. However, there is no explicit mention that Charlie Chan's Chance is about American films.\n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that the statement \"Charlie Chan's Chance is about American films\" would be correct."

This information supports that \"Charlie Chan's Chance\" is about an American film, hence affirming the statement that Charlie Chan's Chance is about American films."
