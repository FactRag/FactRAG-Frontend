However, none of these documents explicitly mention a postal code of 771100 for Gombe State.\n\nIn fact, one of the documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2108/re-ranker-msmarco/3.txt) states that the first digit of Gombe State's postal code represents its region, and another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2108/re-ranker-msmarco/30.txt) lists the postal codes for various local government areas in Gombe State, including one starting with 760.\n\nThis suggests that a postal code of 771100 is not supported by the information provided."
