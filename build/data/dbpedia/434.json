They are separate entities operating within the San Marinese government. \n"

The party does have representatives in the council, as mentioned in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_434/re-ranker-msmarco/8.txt, but this doesn't necessarily imply affiliation or ownership.\n\nIf you'd like me to provide more details on my reasoning, feel free to ask!"
