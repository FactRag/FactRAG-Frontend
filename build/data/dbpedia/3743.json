This information supports the triple statement about the birth place of Elisa Izquierdo's murder being New York."

While specific sources like `92.txt` and `18.txt` provide additional details about her birth (such as the exact date of February 11, 1989, at Woodhull Hospital), the key information regarding her birth place being New York is consistent across multiple documents. Therefore, the statement that \"The birth place of Elisa Izquierdo's murder is New York\" is supported by the context provided."
