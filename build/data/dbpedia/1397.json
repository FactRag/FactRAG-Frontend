This does not mention an imperial unit width of 252 inches, so the statement \"The width of Tau (sculpture) in imperial units is 252\" cannot be supported by the documents."

These dimensions are given in imperial units (feet), but they do not match the provided width of 252 inches (which would be equivalent to 21 feet). Therefore, the statement that the width of Tau is 252 inches is incorrect based on the information provided in the documents."
