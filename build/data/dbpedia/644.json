However, based on the provided context information, we can infer that Gro\u00df Strehlitz was part of Germany in 1916. But strictly speaking, the documents do not explicitly state that the German Empire existed anymore in 1916, as the Kingdom of Prussia was already part of it.\n\nA more accurate answer would be:\n{\n  \"output\": \"maybe\"\n}\n\nAs there is some ambiguity about the precise date and existence of the German Empire at the time Erich Mende was born."
