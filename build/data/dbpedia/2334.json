Here's my response:\n\n**Triple:** The Battle of Pancorbo (1808) is a subject of Category:Conflicts in 1808.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n* There are multiple documents that mention the Battle of Pancorbo, but they refer to different years:\n\t+ One document mentions the battle took place on October 31, 1808.\n\t+ Another document mentions the battle took place in 816.\n* Since one of the documents explicitly states that the Battle of Pancorbo (1808) is mentioned separately from another battle with the same name in the year 816, we can conclude that the query refers to the specific event in 1808.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there are multiple battles named \"Pancorbo\" with different years and contexts, one of the documents specifically mentions a conflict in 1808. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThe information supports the triple that The Battle of Pancorbo (1808) is a subject of Category:Conflicts in 1808."
