This inconsistency makes me lean towards a \"no\" answer for this triple.\n\nIf you want to consider only the second and first documents (ignoring the third one), then I would answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nBut based on all the available context, I believe a cautious \"no\" is more accurate."
