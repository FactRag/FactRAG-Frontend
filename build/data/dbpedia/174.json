While the specific mention of Ezzatabad is not directly stated, it can be inferred that since Qutur District contains Ezzatabad and Qutur District is a subdivision of Khoy County, then Ezzatabad is indeed a subdivision of Khoy County. Therefore, the statement \"Ezzatabad is a subdivision of Khoy County\" is supported by the documents."
