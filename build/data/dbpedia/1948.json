However, none of them specify that the information is about video games set in Iran.\n\nIn fact, one of the documents mentions that the story takes place in \"sixth century Persia\" (which refers to modern-day Iran), but it does not exclusively focus on video games or specifically mention Iran as the setting.\n\nAnother document mentions an Indian palace as the setting for The Sands of Time, while others describe the game's storyline and development. Therefore, the information provided does not fully support the triple statement that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is about video games set in Iran."

Therefore, the statement is supported by the given information."

While the game indeed involves a setting related to historical Persian/Iranian elements, it does not strictly fall under the category of being \"about Video games set in Iran\" as suggested by the query. Rather, the documents indicate that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is primarily described as an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft Montreal. It also describes a film adaptation produced by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\nThe context does not support stating that it is about video games set in Iran; instead, it's more accurate to describe the content as being based on or involving settings related to historical Persian/Iranian themes. Therefore, given the exact phrasing of the query and the details provided in the documents, the answer is \"no\"."
