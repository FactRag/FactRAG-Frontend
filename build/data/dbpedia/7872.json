However, based on the provided context information, it appears that Yul Brynner's connection to White Russians is more related to his family and mother being part of a community of Russian refugees in Shanghai, but he himself did not migrate to China. Additionally, there are mentions of his experiences as a trapeze artist, actor, and emigrant from Vladivostok to Paris and later the US, without any specific connection to becoming a White Russian emigrant to China.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it does not seem that Yul Brynner's subject is accurately described by Category:White Russian emigrants to China."
