They also mention that in the same state, Libertarian Stan Jones won 3.2 percent in the 2002 general election and made headlines in 2006 because he garnered 2.6 percent, which was triple the 0.88-point victory margin of Jon Tester over GOP Senator Conrad Burns.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the documents, it appears that this statement is actually referring to Jones' vote share being a small fraction of Tester's 0.88 point victory margin, not three times that amount. Therefore, the correct response is \"no\"."
