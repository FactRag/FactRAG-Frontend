It mentions an earthquake in 1853 and destruction during the Filipino-American War, but does not indicate any Renaissance Revival style elements. Instead, it references a Roman Catholic parish with historical significance, noting its transformation from original structures to modern updates, which includes a current aesthetic transformation towards traditional architecture, but does not specify a Renaissance Revival architectural style.",
