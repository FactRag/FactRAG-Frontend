The first document simply states that it airs on Nickelodeon without giving more context, while the other documents either give additional information about the show (e.g. its premiere date) or mention that it was produced in collaboration with Nickelodeon but do not specify that it only aired on that network. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot confirm whether The Penguins of Madagascar is exclusive to Nickelodeon, and thus the answer is \"no\"."
