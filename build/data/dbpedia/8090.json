In fact, the documents suggest the opposite: that these Bell companies are subsidiaries of Ameritech."

There is no mention of Illinois Bell being a parent company to Ameritech; instead, they are presented as separate entities with Ameritech acquiring or inheriting parts of what was once the Bell System."
