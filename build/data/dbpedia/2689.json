However, in this case, we are evaluating whether the information in the documents supports the idea that \"Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus\" is known by a different name (i.e., not just the same name).\n\nThe documents provide information about Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus being a Roman Senator and consul who was a friend of the Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius, but they do not mention him being known by any other name.\n\nIn fact, one document even states \"Marcus Aurelius\" as a separate entity from \"Cotta Maximus Messalinus\", implying that they are two distinct individuals. \n\nTherefore, the output should be \"no\"."

The first two names \"Marcus Aurelius\" refer to a different historical figure, the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, while the rest of the name appears to belong to another individual, Cotta Maximus Messalinus, who was a Roman senator and consul. This suggests that the full name is likely a mistake or a mix-up of two separate individuals with distinct names.",
