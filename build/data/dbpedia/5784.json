In fact, one of the documents mentions that the Iban language has regional dialects, implying that it is a distinct language from Malay."

However, it does not explicitly confirm that the Iban people primarily speak the Malay language. Therefore, the statement \"Iban people speak Malay language\" cannot be confirmed as correct based on the provided information."
