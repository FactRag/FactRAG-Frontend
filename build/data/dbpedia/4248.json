This suggests that Kuntsevo is indeed a location where Stalin lived and passed away.\n\nAdditionally, other documents mention the Kuntsevo Dacha as Joseph Stalin's personal residence near the former town of Kuntsevo (now part of Moscow's Fili district).\n\nTherefore, considering the context information provided:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
