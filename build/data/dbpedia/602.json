Here's why:\n\n* Document from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_602/re-ranker-msmarco/68.txt states: \"The order Apodida are invariably vermiform infaunal sea cucumbers... This is consistent with fossil records (Reich, 2010, Reich, 2015). Thus far, five mitogenomes of Apodida species were analyzed.\"\n* Document from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_602/re-ranker-msmarco/44.txt states: \"Class Holothuroidea is represented by the taxonomic orders Apodida, Elasipodida, Holothuriida, Dendrochirotida, Persiculida, Molpadida, and Synallactida (Miller et al., 2017)... About 50 species of this class are known for the Brazilian coast; of these, 14 belong to the order Holothuriida...\"\n* Document from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_602/re-ranker-msmarco/44.txt also states that \"Holothuriida is one of the most diverse orders of the class Holothuroidea.\"\n\nThese statements suggest that Apodida is indeed a subject within the category Category:Holothuroidea.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
