In fact, one of the documents mentions that the ensemble was formed in 1992 by parent organization Bang on a Can, which may imply a different country or origin."

These documents indicate that the group performs throughout the U.S. and internationally and was formed in 1992 as part of an organization based in New York City (as seen from the references to \"Bang on a Can\"). This supports that the band is indeed associated with the United States.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Bang on a Can All-Stars is from the United States can be evaluated as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```\n\nThe group's activities and origins align well with being from or representing the United States."
