According to file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7069/re-ranker-msmarco/14.txt, Sommerfeld was a teaching staff member and Privatdozent at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg (Vita), and later offered an assistantship in Voigt's laboratory. This implies that he had students who could have been advised by him academically, including Iris Runge, a prominent mathematician."

Given the context of academic mentorship and the importance placed on Sommerfeld's role in the development of quantum theory, it is reasonable to infer that he would have advised doctoral candidates, including Iris Runge (a notable German chemist who did indeed receive her doctorate under his supervision), thus supporting the statement."
