However, one of the documents mentions that the remix is released by Sydney label Sweat It Out, and another document mentions that Sweat It Out has a sister label called Central Station Records. This implies that Luude is likely to be associated with Sweat It Out or Central Station Records, which are labels, rather than the label itself being \"Down Under\"."

The documents discuss legal issues related to the song's royalties, its popularity in various countries, and a remix by Luude featuring Colin Hay, but none mention the song being labeled as 'Down Under'."
