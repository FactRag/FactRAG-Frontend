The first two files mention his birth on June 19, 1912, and July is not mentioned at all as a possible month of birth, and the last file confirms that he was born in Pittsburg, Kansas. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that Don Gutteridge was indeed born in Pittsburg, Kansas."
