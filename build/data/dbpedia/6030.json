However, there is no explicit mention of the language of the films or the novel being discussed.\n\nHowever, one of the documents mentions that the film \"Village of the Damned (1995)\" was released in the United States and has a budget and box office gross stated in US dollars, which implies that it's an English-language film. Additionally, another document mentions that the original 1960 British film \"Village of the Damned\" is being remade, which further supports the idea that the original film is indeed a British production.\n\nGiven this information, I would conclude that:\n\n*Response: {'output': 'yes'}*"

The plot involves an English village experiencing unusual events leading to unexplained pregnancies and strange births. Thus, the information supports that the subject matter is related to English-language films, considering its setting and nature of storytelling."
