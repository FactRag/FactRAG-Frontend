This suggests that while \"China\" and \"PRC\" refer to the same country, they are not always used interchangeably, especially in marketing contexts. Therefore, the statement \"The label of China is 'China'\" is incorrect based on the provided documents."

However, the query seems to ask about whether it's accurate or not in comparison to the use of \"PRC\" as an alternative label. According to the documents, while products can be labeled as \"Made in PRC,\" there are legal requirements that may necessitate using \"China.\" Therefore, strictly speaking and according to international shipping regulations mentioned:\n\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n\nThis is because legally and explicitly on certain platforms or for certain purposes, the country name \"China\" must indeed be used. The label 'PRC' can be used domestically or strategically but for compliance with some international standards, especially in customs documentation, it's necessary to use \"Made in China.\" However, this answer emphasizes legal requirements rather than everyday usage practices which allow for both terms interchangeably due to common understanding."
