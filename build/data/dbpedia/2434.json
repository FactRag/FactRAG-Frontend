However, based on the context information provided, we can try to evaluate the statement.\n\nThe statement claims that the homepage of the Victoria Memorial (India) is 'http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/'. To evaluate this, let's look at the context information:\n\nOne document mentions \"Victoria Memorial Light and Sound Show\" with a website URL starting with \"https://victoriameuseum.gov.in/\", but this URL seems to be related to the museum and not the memorial.\n\nAnother document mentions \"Victoria Memorial Hall of Kolkata (aka Calcutta), West Bengal, India.  It was erected as a tribute to Queen Victoria of Great Britain during British occupation of India.\" but does not mention any website.\n\nNone of the documents mention the homepage URL 'http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/'. However, one document mentions \"Victoria Memorial Gallery is open from 10 am to 5 pm\" and another document mentions \"This magnificent monument cum museum stands as a reminder of the city\u2019s colonial and architectural heritage.\" which implies that there might be some official website related to Victoria Memorial. \n\nHowever, we cannot confirm whether 'http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/' is the correct homepage URL for Victoria Memorial based on the provided context.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n{'output': 'no'}"
