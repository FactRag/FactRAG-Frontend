While there are mentions of Maria Letizia Bonaparte and her husband Prince Amadeo of Savoy (Duke of Aosta) throughout the documents, they are mostly related to their marriage, family life, and historical context, but not specifically about burials at the Basilica of Superga. The document that seems most relevant is actually \"file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_968/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt\" which talks about the Basilica of Superga, but it mentions a different aspect (the difference between Greek and Latin cross plans) and not specifically Maria Letizia Bonaparte's burial."
