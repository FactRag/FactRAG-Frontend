In fact, most of the documents mention her as a San Francisco jazz and blues vocalist, which suggests that she is associated with San Francisco (which is in California) rather than explicitly stating that she is from the US. However, one document does mention her as \"an American actress and model\" (Pamela Rose Rodriguez Bio), but this seems to be referring to a different person altogether.\n\nIt's also worth noting that another document mentions Pam Rose performing at events and festivals in the US, Germany, and Denmark, which suggests that she may have a broader geographic scope for her work. However, this does not necessarily confirm that she is from the US."
