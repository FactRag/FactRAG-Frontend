Menezes, which likely refers to Alfred Menezes given the context.\n* Both documents mention Alfred Menezes without any alternate labels or indications that his name might be different.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that the triple \"The label of Alfred Menezes is Alfred Menezes\" is indeed supported by the context."
