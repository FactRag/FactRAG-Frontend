While it does mention Prosperita Open as one of the tennis tournaments held in the country, there is no specific information about a 2010 edition.\n* Document 73 repeats the same information as document 77, but again mentions that the tournament took place in 2011, not 2010.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the statement \"The subject of 2010 Prosperita Open is Category:2010 in Czech sport\" is incorrect. There is no mention of a 2010 edition of the Prosperita Open in any of the provided documents.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
