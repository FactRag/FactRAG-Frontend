In fact, the documents mention different professions and roles for Richard Boggs (e.g. scientist, counselor, store manager), which suggests a more complex and nuanced labeling of his profession."

However, they do not indicate any connection to the authorship of \"Alas, Babylon\" or any political office in Iraq or Nobel Prize in Literature awards. The query specifically asks for confirmation of the label \"Richard Boggs,\" which is supported by the documents mentioning Richard Boggs multiple times with his profession details."
