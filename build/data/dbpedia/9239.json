This clearly indicates that the Tibetan tangka was the currency used in Tibet before 1951. \n\n\n\n"

The period mentioned in the question, \"1912\u201351\", partially overlaps with the period during which the Tangka was still used in Tibet (up to 1941), but it also includes a period when other currencies were already being used."
