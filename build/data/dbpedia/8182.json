This suggests that there is a religious establishment by the name of Weissenau but does not confirm if it is commonly known as \"Weissenau Abbey.\"\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively support or refute the statement that the common name of Weissenau Abbey is Weissenau. However, based on the provided instructions and data:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis response assumes a cautious approach given the lack of direct supporting evidence within the documents for the specific claim made in the query."
