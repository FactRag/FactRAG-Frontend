However, there is no specific mention of the industry being directly related to \"Electricity generation\".\n\nUpon reviewing the text, I see that Solar Turbines' products include:\n\n* Gas turbine engines (rated from 1,590 to 52,500 horsepower)\n* Gas compressors\n* Gas turbine-powered compressor sets, mechanical-drive packages and generator sets (ranging from 1 to 39 megawatts)\n\nThese products are indeed related to power generation, but the text does not explicitly state that Solar Turbines operates in the industry of \"Electricity generation\". It mentions oil, natural gas, and power generation projects, which is a broader category.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThe triple is incorrect according to the documents."
