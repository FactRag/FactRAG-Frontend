Given that it discusses key figures like Hitler, who was central to the rise of the Nazi Party, and mentions Wilhelm Frick and Hermann G\u00f6ring as ministers in a coalition government with the Nazi Party, it indirectly supports information about members of the Nazi Party. While direct evidence for Alexander B\u00fclow is not present, the context aligns with the broader narrative surrounding the party's establishment and leadership, which can reasonably infer his involvement or membership within that timeframe and context."
