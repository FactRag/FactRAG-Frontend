In fact, one document mentions that this line-up was from a later time period.\n\nHowever, another document does mention Status Quo as the artist, but it's in the context of an acoustic album and tour, which is not necessarily related to the 1983 \"Back to Back\" album.\n\nIf you meant to ask about a different album by Status Quo, please let me know!"
