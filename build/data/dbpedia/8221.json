In fact, one document even describes Mamiya as \"'a Phase One company'\" on its global website. Additionally, the acquisition of Mamiya Digital Imaging Company Ltd by Phase One is mentioned in several documents, which further supports the notion that Phase One has taken control of Mamiya.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that Phase One is indeed a subsidiary of Mamiya."
