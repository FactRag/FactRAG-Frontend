It consists of several stacked layers of cells, with the apical layer being squamous and the basal layer containing columnar or cuboidal cells. The top layer of some stratified squamous epithelia is called the keratinized epithelium and is covered with dead cells filled with keratin.\n\nNow, let's evaluate whether this information supports the triple:\n\nTriple: Stratified squamous epithelium is primarily about on Wikipedia.\n\nFrom the context information, we can see that Stratified squamous epithelium is a topic of discussion in medical texts, specifically in documents related to human anatomy and physiology. There is no mention of Wikipedia or online encyclopedias. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Stratified squamous epithelium is primarily about on Wikipedia.\n\nHowever, based on the provided context information, we can see that Stratified squamous epithelium is indeed a type of tissue that provides protection against abrasion and friction, which suggests that it might be an important concept in medical textbooks or online resources like Wikipedia. Therefore, I would say that the triple \"Stratified squamous epithelium is primarily about on Wikipedia\" might not be entirely accurate.\n\nHere's my answer:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
