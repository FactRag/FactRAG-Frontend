The document related to \"The Toilers and the Wayfarers\" mentions a film set in a German-American town, but it does not explicitly discuss immigration."

For instance, multiple sources discuss significant waves of German immigration during the 19th and early 20th centuries due to various reasons such as political unrest, economic opportunities, and discrimination in their home country. This information supports the idea that \"The Toilers and the Wayfarers\" is about German emigrants to the United States."
