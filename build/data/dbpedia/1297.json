However, none of them explicitly state that his label or name is \"Matt McColm\" (note the capitalization). In fact, most of the documents use a lowercase \"m\" when referring to him.\n\nThis subtle detail suggests that the triple might be incorrect, as it implies a specific capitalization convention for Matt McColm's name."
