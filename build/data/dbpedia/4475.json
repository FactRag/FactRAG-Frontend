In Washington D.C., many monuments are oriented along a grid system with north-south and east-west axes labeled as such. However, without more specific information about this particular monument or its location, we cannot definitively say that the latitude direction is North.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit information in the documents to support the triple, I would have to conclude:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"

Therefore, without contradictory information, we can infer that its latitude direction could be north, hence the answer \"yes\"."
