Swannack, Jr. multiple times, and in each instance, he is referred to as a Major General or a retired U.S. Army Major General.\n* His actions and statements are also attributed to his role as a military officer, such as commanding the 82nd Airborne Division and serving in Iraq.\n* There is no indication that his allegiance is anything other than with the U.S. Army.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it appears that the triple \"Charles H. Swannack, Jr.'s allegiance is with the U.S. Army\" is supported by the documents."
