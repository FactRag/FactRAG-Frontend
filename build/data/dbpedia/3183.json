But there's another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3183/re-ranker-msmarco/71.txt) which mentions \"Shanghai Kemao Pharmaceutical Packaging Materials Co., Ltd.\" and not \"Kemao Market\". This leads me to believe that there might be two different entities: Kemao Market in Beijing, China and another company named Kemao in Shanghai, China.\n\nConsidering this context, I'm inclined to say that the statement \"Kemao Market is located in China\" is true but not entirely accurate. While Kemao Market is indeed located in Haidian district of Beijing (which is in China), there might be some confusion with another company named Kemao operating in Shanghai. However, since the question doesn't specify which entity to focus on, I'll assume it's referring to Kemao Market.\n\nSo, my answer would be:\n{'output': 'yes'}\n\nPlease note that this evaluation is based on the provided context information and might not reflect a more nuanced understanding of the entities involved."
