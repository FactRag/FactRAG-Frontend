The 17th Battalion was merged with the 2nd Battalion to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1987 (document 17). This new unit was assigned to the 8th Brigade, which is attached to the 2nd Division (Australia) (document 17).\n\nTherefore, the information supports the triple that The 17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment is structured under the 2nd Division (Australia), with a value of \"yes\"."
