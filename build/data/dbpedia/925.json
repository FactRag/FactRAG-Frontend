This suggests that the current name of the company is indeed REVCO Lighting + Electrical Supply, Inc., not Revco, D.S., Inc. However, I must note that the query seems to be asking if the name \"Revco\" alone without context or further specification (such as \"D.S., INC.\") matches one of the names mentioned in the documents. Given the ambiguity and lack of specificity, a more nuanced interpretation would be required for a definitive answer.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that \"Revco's name is Revco, D.S., Inc.\" can indeed be supported given the mention of \"REVCO D.S., INC.\" as the current company name in multiple documents."
