However, none of these names explicitly match the triple \"Opopanax (plant)\".\n* The documents do mention that the term \"Opopanax\" is a source of confusion, as it is used for different products and plants. This suggests that the label \"Opopanax (plant)\" might not accurately reflect the complexity of the plant's name.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I would conclude that the information in the documents does not strongly support the triple \"The label of the Opopanax (plant) is 'Opopanax (plant)'\". Therefore:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
