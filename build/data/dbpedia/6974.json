Several documents mention its categorization as a romantic drama or highlight themes of relationships and interactions between two individuals.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Based on the context, it's reasonable to infer that the subject of the \"John and Mary\" film aligns with 1960s drama films.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more triples you'd like me to evaluate!"

Additionally, details about the characters' interactions and the setting (an industrial-looking loft-type apartment) suggest elements of drama typical for films from that era. However, given the specific query about the subject matter being \"1960s drama films,\" and considering the document only discusses this film without explicitly stating it's a 1960s drama, the answer leans towards \"yes\" based on the context provided."
