The first document states that the U.S. is generally considered the third largest country in the world, behind Russia and Canada.\n2. However, another source (World Population Review and Worldometer) lists China as slightly larger than the U.S. in both land area and total area.\n3. The second document confirms that the U.S. is the third largest country in the world based on land area.\n4. A fourth document provides a list of the top 50 states by area, with Alaska being the largest state, followed by Texas, California, and so on.\n\nBased on this information, I would conclude that:\n\n{\n\"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n\nThe context information does support the triple \"The U.S. is the third largest country in the world\". The first document provides a general statement about the U.S.'s ranking among countries, while the second document specifically confirms this status based on land area."
