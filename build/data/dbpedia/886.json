Specifically:\n\n* The first document mentions \"Jadranski naftovod, commonly known as 'JANAF'... in Croatia\".\n* The third document states \"Croatia's state oil storage and transport company Jadranski naftovod (JANAF)...\".\n* The fifth document reports on a Croatian company signing contracts with INA-Industrija nafte, which implies that Jadranski naftovod is also based in Croatia.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Jadranski naftovod is located in Croatia\" is supported by the information provided."
