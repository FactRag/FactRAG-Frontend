However, since the document does mention that it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2015 and was released around the same time based on other reviews, we can make an educated guess.\n\nBut there is a document (document 3) that states: \"The film will debut at this year\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival as a Gala presentation.\" The phrase \"this year\" suggests that it refers to the festival in 2015. This supports the idea that Septembers of Shiraz is indeed about 2015 films.\n\nHowever, there's another document (document 4) that mentions: \"based on the best-selling novel by Dalia Sofer\". It doesn't explicitly confirm or deny the category of \"2015 films\" but it does mention the release of a movie based on a novel. \n\nTherefore:\n\n{\n    \"output\": \"maybe\"\n}"
