Additionally, several documents mention that Hu\u1ebf was the former imperial capital of the Nguyen dynasty from 1802 to 1945, which implies that it was the capital of the Empire of Vietnam during that time period. Therefore, the statement \"The capital of the Empire of Vietnam is Hu\u1ebf\" is supported by the information in the documents."
