While it doesn't explicitly mention the location, document 102 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2781/re-ranker-msmarco/102.txt) mentions \"X-treme Parasail in Honolulu\" which is a different entity.\n\nGiven this information, I would say that the location of X-treme Close-Up is not explicitly stated as being in the United States. However, it is related to an American band, and one of the documents (97.txt) implies its connection to America. \n\nBut the best evidence we have points towards a more ambiguous statement.\n\nSo my answer will be:\n{'output': 'no'}"
