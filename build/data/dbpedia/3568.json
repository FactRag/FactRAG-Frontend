The documents mention \"the military aviation branch of the Netherlands Armed Forces\" (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3568/re-ranker-msmarco/57.txt), which implies that it's more specific than just being a branch of \"the Air Force\".\n\nTherefore, I would say that the information in the documents **does not explicitly support** the triple, and thus:\n\n**Response:** {'output': 'no'}"
