However, this second document does not provide information on the death date of the first mentioned Sultan Mudzaffar Shah I (the one from Kedah). Therefore, it cannot be determined whether the death year 1179 is correct for the Sultan Mudzafar Shah I mentioned in the initial context."

However, further down in the text, it mentions \"Sultan Mudzaffar Shah I\" again, this time in relation to a ruler of Kedah who reigned from 1136 to 1179. This inconsistency suggests that there might be two separate individuals with similar names and dates, but only one is mentioned as dying in 1179.",
