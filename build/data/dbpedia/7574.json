The information in the files suggests that Andautonia was a Roman settlement located near the current city of Zagreb, and that it predates the founding of Zagreb itself (with the name \"Zagreb\" first appearing in a document dated 1134). Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that Zagreb was originally known as Andautonia."
