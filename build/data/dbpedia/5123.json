For example, one document describes it as a \"stealth-action game\", another mentions that it has gameplay mechanics typical of stealth action-adventure games, and yet another calls it an \"action 28 November 2002\". Therefore, the triple statement \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a game\" is supported by the documents."
