It highlights the importance of cotton textile production and cacao in generating profits for the magistrates, with figures such as 12,000 pesos and 14,000 pesos mentioned. The text also notes that some posts could be sold for small fortunes due to their economic value.\n\nGiven this context, it is reasonable to infer that the unit preference of Escuintla, Chiapas would indeed be Imperial, as the document suggests a strong connection between the region's economy and the Spanish colonial system."
