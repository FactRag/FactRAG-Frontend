In fact, there are multiple mentions of people with the surname \"Timbs\" across different generations and locations. While one document mentions a \"John Joseph Timbs (1905-1975)\", it does not provide any information that confirms this person's full name as \"Timbs, John\"."

While the documents do not explicitly state his full name as \"Timbs, John,\" they consistently refer to him as \"John Timbs.\" Given that surnames typically precede given names in formal introductions or titles, it is reasonable to infer that \"Timbs\" is his surname and \"John\" his given name.
