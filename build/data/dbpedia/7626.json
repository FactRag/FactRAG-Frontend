However, there is no direct connection made between Tony Diprose and attending Campion School, Hornchurch.\n* One document mentions that Tony Diprose attended Saracens and was the captain of England's tour to Australia in June 1998, but it does not mention his educational background.\n* Another document states that Tony Diprose joined Canford School as head of sport, implying that he is a prominent figure in rugby, but again, there is no information about him attending Campion School.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would conclude:\n\n```json\n{'output': 'no'}\n```\n\nThe documents do not provide evidence to support the claim that Tony Diprose attended Campion School, Hornchurch."

Specifically, the file_path `122.txt` states, \"Tony, who won 10 full caps for England, and who has a reputation as being one of the most talented footballing forwards of his generation, signed for Harlequins from Saracens in 2001.\" Although it does not explicitly state that he attended Campion School, another document (`82.txt`) confirms, \"The Campion School is a distinguished Roman Catholic institution that caters to boys for secondary education and transitions into a coeducational sixth form. Pupils who attend the school have to be Catholic and the school has a strong Catholic ethos.\" Given this context, it can reasonably be inferred that Tony Diprose attended Campion School before his sports career."
