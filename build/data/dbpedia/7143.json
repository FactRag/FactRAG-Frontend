Although primarily focused on extraction of minerals, Rio Tinto also has significant operations in refining, particularly for refining bauxite and iron ore.\"\n- Document `4.txt`: \"Rio Tinto Group was founded in 1873 and is headquartered in London, the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThese snippets indicate that the headquarters of Rio Tinto Group is located in the United Kingdom."
