One document mentions that Opopanax chironium is a herb in the Apiaceae family, which is a family of plants. Another document mentions that Opopanax W. Koch genus is included in the Apiaceae family, and it is known as \"Hercules' all-heal\", indicating that it is indeed a plant. Therefore, the triple \"Opopanax (plant) belongs to the kingdom of Plant\" is supported by the documents."
