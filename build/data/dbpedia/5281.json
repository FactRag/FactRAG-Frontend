This suggests that he started his acting career around 1988.\n* There are multiple mentions of Bill Nunn's roles and films throughout the 1990s, such as Mo' Better Blues (1990), He Got Game (1998), and Spider-Man trilogy (2002-2007). However, this does not necessarily mean that he stopped being active in the film industry after 1988.\n* The documents do not provide a clear indication of when Bill Nunn ended his acting career or went inactive.\n\nGiven this information, I would say that the statement \"Bill Nunn was active from 1988\" is partially supported. While it is true that he started his acting career in 1988, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that he stopped being active after that year.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the statement is incorrect, but rather that it is an oversimplification of Bill Nunn's acting career. A more accurate statement might be \"Bill Nunn started his acting career in 1988\" or \"Bill Nunn was active in the film industry from at least 1988.\""
