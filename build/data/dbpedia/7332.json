This implies that he was not originally from Bloemfontein, but rather had a connection there through his rugby career.\n\nGiven this information, I would say that the documents provide conflicting evidence regarding Piet Lindeque's attendance of Bloemfontein as an individual (as opposed to his rugby-related activities). However, since the triple specifically asks about attending Bloemfontein, and one document explicitly states that he \"began his career\" there, I will consider this sufficient support for the triple.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
