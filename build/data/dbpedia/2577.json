He was born in Buffalo, New York on November 2, 1956.\"\n\nThis document does not explicitly mention that Dale Brown is a novelist from the 21st century or that he belongs to the category \"Category:21st-century American novelists\".\n\nHowever, we can infer this information indirectly. The document mentions that Dale Brown was born in 1956 and has written numerous novels, including some published in the 1980s (e.g., Flight of the Old Dog, 1987). This implies that he is a novelist from the late 20th century or early 21st century.\n\nBut, there is no explicit information about him being categorized under \"Category:21st-century American novelists\".\n\nSo, while the document does not directly support the triple, it also doesn't contradict it. But since we cannot affirmatively state that Dale Brown belongs to this category based on the provided documents, I'll provide a conservative answer.\n\nHowever, given the information in the documents and the general knowledge about the timeline of Dale Brown's career (being born in 1956 and starting his writing career with \"Flight of the Old Dog\" in 1987), it is likely that he would be considered a novelist from the late 20th century to the present.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}\n\nBut keep in mind that this is not an absolute affirmation based solely on the provided documents, but rather an educated inference."
