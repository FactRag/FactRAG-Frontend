However, according to the documents (specifically file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9034/re-ranker-msmarco/12.txt), Telefon Tel Aviv was formed in New Orleans and later based in Chicago. The document also mentions that Josh Eustis and Charlie Cooper, the founding members of the group, were originally from New Orleans. Therefore, the hometown of Telefon Tel Aviv is not explicitly stated as being solely \"United States\", but rather it has been associated with multiple cities (New Orleans, Chicago, Los Angeles)."
