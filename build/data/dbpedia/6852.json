For example, document 21.txt mentions him backing Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon at Jazzhus Montmartre in Copenhagen, where Count Basie also performed. Similarly, document 42.txt states that he accompanied American jazz musicians touring Europe, including Count Basie, although it notes that Count Basie did not end up being a sideman of Pedersen's after all."

Therefore, the information supports the statement that Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen was associated with Count Basie."
