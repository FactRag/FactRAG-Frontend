Additionally, document 6 states that the Museo Jumex was founded by Eugenio L\u00f3pez Alonso, a member of the multi-billion-dollar Grupo Jumex family. This information collectively suggests that Eugenio L\u00f3pez Alonso is indeed closely associated with the Jumex company and its related institutions."
