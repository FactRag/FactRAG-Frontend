While one document mentions that the DIT uses a component model of moral development devised by James Rest in 1979, this is referring to the person's model of moral development, not the DIT itself being a model."

It was devised by James Rest in 1979 and later established as a research tool at the University of Minnesota's Center for the Study of Ethical Development. The DIT serves to measure an individual\u2019s moral reasoning skills based on Kohlberg\u2019s stages of moral development, encompassing schema such as preconventional, conventional, and post-conventional levels of moral judgment. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the Defining Issues Test is a model in the context of measuring moral development and reasoning."
