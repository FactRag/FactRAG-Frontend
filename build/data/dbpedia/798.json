The documents actually mention two different bands/projects named \"Love Is Blind\": one seems to be related to Netflix's reality show and another to Annie Taylor, which released a song called \"Love Is Blind\"."

The documents mention \"Love Is Blind\" in the context of a Netflix show and a band named Annie Taylor's single, but there is no reference to Claire Voyant's album with this title."
