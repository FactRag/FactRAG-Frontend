Service number assignment was 34075321.\"\n\nAdditionally, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3593/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt) mentions that Henderson transferred to the United States Army Air Forces in 1944 as Private first class. While this does not directly state that he served in the United States Army, it is implied by his transfer to the Army Air Forces.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I can confirm that Joseph Henderson did serve in the United States Army, making the query true according to the documents."
