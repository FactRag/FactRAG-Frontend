Calabar was the capital of this new Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.\" However, it also mentions that \"most of the colonial, diplomatic activities and high-level official businesses were carried out in Lagos\" (emphasis mine), suggesting that while Calabar may have been the capital on paper, Lagos was the de facto center of activity. Document 5.txt further solidifies this by stating that the Southern Nigeria Protectorate had its capital in Lagos until it was amalgamated with the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914, which makes Lagos the capital of a unified Nigeria from then on."
