They also mention that Wang Mang introduced a total of four major currency reforms which resulted in 37 different kinds of money, including ones made of substances like tortoiseshell, cowries, gold, silver, copper. However, they do not specifically state that the currency of the Xin dynasty was Silver.\n\nIn fact, one document mentions that the Huo Quan (\u8ca8\u6cc9) cash coins introduced during the Xin dynasty would continue to be produced for some time after its fall, which suggests that the currency of the Xin dynasty may have been something other than Silver."
