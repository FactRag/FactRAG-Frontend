While it is true that he was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer (document 1), his works are more characterized by a raw and unfiltered perspective on life, society, and the human experience (documents 3-4). The documents also mention his association with the \"Dirty Realism\" literary movement and his depiction of the harsh realities of life (documents 1 and 3), which is not specific to novelists. Therefore, the triple is incorrect according to the documents."
