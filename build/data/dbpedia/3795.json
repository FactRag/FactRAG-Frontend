            "full_ans": "Here is the structured JSON format for your query:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe documents mention St. George's Episcopal Church in relation to Charles Washington, who was a vestryman and warden at this church from 1765 to 1773. Additionally, one of the documents mentions Trinity Catholic Church but then also references St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church as having been proposed around the same time period (1814-1815) in Washington, D.C. This suggests that there were multiple churches with different affiliations operating in the area.\n\nHowever, another document specifically mentions Berry Hill and its association with a family named Thornton Washington, who was related to John Thornton Augustine Washington through his son Benjamin Franklin Washington. Although this does not explicitly mention an affiliation, it suggests a connection to the larger Washington family, who are mentioned as being involved with various churches in the area.\n\nWhile there is no direct statement that John Thornton Augustine Washington is affiliated with the Episcopal Church (United States), the indirect connections and associations between his relatives and church affiliations suggest that he might be affiliated with the same denomination. Therefore, based on these indirect hints, I would classify the output as \"yes\"."

While not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that members of the Washington family were affiliated with the Episcopal Church (United States), given that Augustine Washington was involved in Anglican Church activities and George Washington himself is well-known to have been an Episcopalian."
