The language of these activities (podcasting, writing about social issues, creating music videos) suggests proficiency in English."

There is no mention of any writing or literary works specifically by a person named Dream Wife. However, it does not contradict the statement that \"Dream Wife\" (likely referring to the band's name) could be written in English. Since there's no information against this, we can infer it to be true within the given context."
