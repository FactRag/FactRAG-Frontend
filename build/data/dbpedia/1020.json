However, there is no mention of categorizing it under \"Category:Star Soldier\". In fact, file `78.txt` seems to be unrelated to the video game series, but mentions BTS members being removed from a list called \"The Camp's Star Soldier List\".\n\n**Conclusion:** The information in the documents does not support the triple. The value is:\n\n```json\n{'output': 'no'}\n```"
