In fact, one of the Levi Parham entries mentions his hometown as McAlester, Oklahoma, which is part of the United States, but this does not necessarily mean that all individuals with the name \"Parham\" share the same hometown."

This supports the statement that Truck Parham's hometown is the United States, as graduates typically come from or live near their hometowns."
