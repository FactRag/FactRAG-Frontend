Specifically, the text mentions that Harald Wohlrapp argues about conductive arguments within the context of pragmatist thinking and discusses how this aligns with a process (as distinct from product) model of argument. This indicates an interest in Pragmatism as it pertains to understanding the nature of arguments, thus supporting the statement that his main interest is Pragmatism."
