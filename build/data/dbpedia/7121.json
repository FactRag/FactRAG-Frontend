However, there is no mention of Kirti Nagar metro station being related to railway stations in West Delhi district.\n\nInstead, there are mentions of a metro station in Delhi, India (specifically, one that serves the localities of Kirti Nagar) on multiple documents (99.txt, 66.txt, and others), but these do not explicitly mention it as being part of Category: Railway stations in West Delhi district.\n\nHowever, one document (46.txt) does mention \"Kirti Nagar is a district in Delhi, India\" which implies that Kirti Nagar metro station could be related to the district of Kirti Nagar. \n\nTherefore, based on this information, the answer would be:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
