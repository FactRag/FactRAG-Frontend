However, several documents mention data from 2015 and describe changes in population size relative to previous years around this timeframe.\n\nOne of the files specifically mentions: \"On January 1, 2015 Spain had 146,959 fewer people than it did on the same day the year before.\" This indicates that there was a recorded change from one year to the next for the population count in 2015. Although this does not provide an absolute estimate of the total population in 2015, it confirms that data concerning the population size and changes for Spain were available around that time.\n\nTherefore, considering the context provided:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```\n\nThis answer assumes a broad interpretation where having yearly change data implies the existence of an estimate for the year itself. If an absolute population figure is required to qualify as an estimate, then more specific evidence would be needed from the documents to definitively state \"yes\"."
