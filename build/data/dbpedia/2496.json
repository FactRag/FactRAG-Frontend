However, this does not provide information about the specific single being referred to.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2496/re-ranker-msmarco/75.txt, it says: \"Girlfriend\" was released as the lead single from Avril Lavigne's third studio album, The Best Damn Thing (2007). This suggests that the song \"Girlfriend\" is a single from the album The Best Damn Thing.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2496/re-ranker-msmarco/36.txt, it says: Girlfried is a Pop song by Avril Lavigne, released on April 17th 2007 in the album The Best Damn Thing (Expanded Edition). This confirms that the song \"Girlfriend\" is indeed a single from the album The Best Damn Thing.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the information provided, it appears that the triple \"The song 'Girlfriend' is this single.\" can be supported by multiple documents. However, since there are different interpretations of what the \"single\" refers to (e.g., third single from Celebrity vs. lead single from The Best Damn Thing), I will provide a cautious answer.\n\n**Response:** {'output': 'yes'}"
