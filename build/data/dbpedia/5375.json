Additionally, the document mentions that USS President was accompanied by a supply ship (Macedonian) and another US ship (United States), which further contradicts the idea of a single strength of 1."

Therefore, the statement that \"The strength of the Capture of USS President is 1\" is incorrect based on the provided context."
