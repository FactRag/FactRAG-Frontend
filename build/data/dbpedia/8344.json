The George Herbert Jones Laboratory itself is also mentioned as being built for the university's chemistry school and having been constructed in 1929. Additionally, one of the documents explicitly states that Room 405 is part of the University of Chicago, and another document mentions that the George Herbert Jones Laboratory \"is a facility building of the University of Chicago.\" Therefore, the statement that The George Herbert Jones Laboratory is governed by the University of Chicago is supported by the information in the documents."

While the documents do not explicitly state \"The George Herbert Jones Laboratory is governed by the University of Chicago,\" it strongly implies this governance due to its description as a facility building and instructional space for the university's research chemists and graduate students. Therefore, based on the context provided, the statement can be considered correct."
