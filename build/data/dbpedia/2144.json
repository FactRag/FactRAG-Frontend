Here's a structured JSON format with the result:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n\nThe reason for this answer is that none of the documents mention Talia Bennett being a subject of Category:Living_people. In fact, one document mentions her age as 21 years old (born in 2003), which suggests she is indeed living, but this information alone is not enough to confirm her categorization under Living_people. However, another document does mention her occupation and pageant history, which does not necessarily imply that she is alive or deceased. There are multiple documents with varying information about Talia Bennett's age and marital status (which also doesn't confirm her as a living person). Hence, the output should be 'no' since there isn't sufficient evidence in the provided context to categorize Talia Bennett under Category:Living_people."
