However, the context information also mentions that Rebibo has lived in different places, including Phoenix, Arizona, and there is no mention of him being born in Rabat again after the initial birthplace in the early life and education section. This suggests that the birthplace in Rabat might have been an error or a specific detail about his family's origin, rather than his actual birthplace.",
