This suggests that the Heinersdorf region, which includes the railway station, is situated to the north of the center of Pankow.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that the information in the documents partially supports the triple. However, since the query asks for a strict \"yes\" or \"no\", and given that the documents do not explicitly state that the station itself is oriented towards the north, I will respond with:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
