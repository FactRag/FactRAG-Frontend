However, the question asks specifically about \"James Tien (politician)\", whose full name according to the context information is actually \"James Tien\". This suggests that the triple \"The full name of James Tien (politician) is James Tien\" may not be accurate, as it does not specify which \"James Tien\" is being referred to."
