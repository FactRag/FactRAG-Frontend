However, he is arguably more famous for being the man who 'made' Dixie Dean. As the man on the opposite flank who supplied many of Dean's goal-scoring opportunities, Troup's involvment in Dean's great footballing achievements - in particular his record 60 goals in a season for Everton - is second to none.\"\n\nThis text indicates that Alex Troup played for Everton F.C., as mentioned in the triple.\n\nThe relevant information from other documents does not contradict this statement.
