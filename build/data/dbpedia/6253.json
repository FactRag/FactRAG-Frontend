They defeated a pair of NCAA Tournament teams, Old Dominion and Michigan.\n* In another document, it is mentioned that \"The Huskies were completing Bender's first swing through the Pac-10, having lost to the first eight conference foes with only 12th-ranked Arizona to play.\"\n* Based on this information, we can infer that the Huskies' performance in the Pac-10 conference was not strong, but there is no specific mention of their exact standing.\n* However, when evaluating the statement \"Bob Bender's conference standing is T\u20137th\", I find that it is supported by the fact that the Huskies finished 9th in the Pacific-10 Conference in 1994 (3-15 record) and had a 10-17 record against the Pac-10 schedule in 1995.\n* There is no information to contradict this statement, so I conclude that the triple is correct.\n\nHere is my response in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"

This indicates that Bob Bender's team was fourth in the conference standings, not tied for seventh. Therefore, the statement \"Bob Bender's conference standing is T\u20137th\" is incorrect based on the provided information."
