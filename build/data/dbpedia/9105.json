However, none of them mention that it's specifically used in the State of Brazil, which is not the same as the country of Brazil. The term \"State of Brazil\" implies a different administrative division within Brazil, but this concept is not mentioned in the provided documents.\n\nWhile the documents do confirm that the currency of Brazil is the Brazilian real (BRL), they don't provide any information about it being used specifically in the State of Brazil. Therefore, the statement \"The currency of State of Brazil is Portuguese real\" cannot be confirmed based on the available context."

However, they do not mention any connection between the state of Brazil and a Portuguese real; instead, they discuss the history and details of the Brazilian Real (plural \u201creais\u201d) introduced to combat hyperinflation. Therefore, the statement \"The currency of State of Brazil is Portuguese real\" is incorrect according to the provided context."
