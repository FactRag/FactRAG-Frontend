The Official Catholic Directory lists Sept. 10, 1941, as the date, and Bishop Silva has a decree dated Aug. 31, 1941, stating that Pope Pius XII established the diocese on Jan. 25, 1941, but this is not mentioned at the time in the local Catholic Herald newspaper. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that the diocese was established on January 25, 1941."
