However, one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7382/re-ranker-msmarco/29.txt) mentions that Sartre read the leading phenomenologists of the day, Husserl, Heidegger, and Scheler, while working at the French Institute in Berlin (1933\u20131934). This suggests that he was influenced by Phenomenology, but it's not clear if he is affiliated with this school of thought. Therefore, I conclude that the triple \"Jean-Paul Sartre is affiliated with the philosophical school Phenomenology\" is not supported by the provided context information."
