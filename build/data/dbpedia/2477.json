While it mentions various roles he held (e.g., medicine show performer, vaudeville entertainer, music publisher), none of them are equivalent to simply being \"Paul Dresser\" (presumably referring to his profession or occupation). The correct professions mentioned in the documents for Paul Dresser are singer, songwriter, and comedic actor."
