W. Bush before that. In fact, one of the documents mentions that he achieved conviction of second-term Jersey City mayor Gerald McCann on charges of defrauding money from a savings and loan scam in 1992, which suggests that Chertoff was already serving as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey at that time."
