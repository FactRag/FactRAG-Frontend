Therefore, without further knowledge, we cannot confirm whether she died in France or not. \n\nHowever, considering the information given, it can be inferred that she did not die in Italy (since her family was in Rome and later lived in Cannes) so the answer could potentially be 'no' assuming \"France\" is what we are evaluating against."

Although it is not explicitly stated where she died, the information strongly implies that she spent her later years in France, which supports the statement that she died in France.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```\n\nHowever, for absolute certainty, we should note that the documents do not clearly state that Princess Maria Francesca of Savoy died in France. The given information suggests it is highly likely but does not confirm it explicitly. Thus, if we strictly adhere to only what is confirmed:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nGiven the context's implication and common practice in such evaluations, the first interpretation would be more appropriate unless instructed otherwise."
