However, there are several mentions of heraldic symbols and coats of arms related to the Holy Roman Empire. For example:\n\n* The text mentions that the \"imperial coat of arms\" was used on the emperor's personal heraldic banner.\n* It also talks about the \"Reichsfahne (Imperial flag)\" which had a white cross on a red field, and the \"Holy Roman Emperor's flag\".\n* Additionally, it mentions that German heraldry refers to the cultural tradition and style of heraldic achievements in modern and historic Germany and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHowever, there is no direct mention of \"Heraldry of the Holy Roman Empire\" as the symbol. Therefore:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
