This suggests that Pascal was influenced by Epictetus.\n* The second document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8468/re-ranker-msmarco/45.txt) mentions that Pascal's views on human existence are contrasted with the stoicism of Epictetus, which further supports the idea that Pascal was influenced by Epictetus."
