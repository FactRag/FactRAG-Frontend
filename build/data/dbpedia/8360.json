The documents indicate he was born in Phanswadi, Mumbai (which is part of Maharashtra), but they also mention that his family roots are deeply connected to Pernem Taluka, Goa. Therefore, the information does not fully support the statement \"Prabhakar Panshikar was born in Maharashtra\" without specifying a more precise location.\n\nHowever, since Phanswadi, Mumbai is indeed in Maharashtra, and the documents provide this as his birthplace, we can infer that he was born there. Thus, considering the broad context of being born in Maharashtra rather than focusing on the specific mention of Goa's connection to his family roots:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```\n\nThis response acknowledges the information given about where Prabhakar Panshikar was born while recognizing that it is specifically in Mumbai, which is part of Maharashtra."
