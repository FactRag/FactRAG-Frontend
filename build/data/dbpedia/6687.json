This is mentioned in documents 25 and 75.\n\nAdditionally, document 75 states that \"Sinhala is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka\", and that it is written using the Sinhala script, which is a descendant of the ancient Indian Brahmi script closely related to the Kadamba script.\n\nThis information suggests that Sinhalese Braille is indeed used in the Sinhalese language, as both are connected to the same linguistic and cultural context."
