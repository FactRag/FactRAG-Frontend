It seems to be referring to an interview with Yves Laferriere, but then mentions Denys Arcand and his film \"Jesus Of Montreal\".\n* The other documents provide more context about the person Yves Laferriere (e.g., a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois bassist and composer), but do not explicitly confirm that he composed music for \"Jesus of Montreal\". In fact, one document even mentions that Jesus von Montreal was directed by Denys Arcand in 1989.\n* However, when looking at the interview within the second document, we find some key information: The person being interviewed (Yves Laferriere) mentions \"He\u2019s the one who wanted urban spacy rock music for \u00abJesus Of Montreal\u00bb\", which suggests that Yves Laferriere was indeed involved in composing music for Jesus of Montreal.\n\nSo, after carefully evaluating all this information, I can confidently say:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
