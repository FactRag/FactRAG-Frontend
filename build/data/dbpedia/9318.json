The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1946-1992) included Montenegro as one of its republics. However, in 2003, Yugoslavia became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, which implies that Montenegro was no longer part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after 1992.\n\nIn fact, according to file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9318/re-ranker-msmarco/37.txt, \"Five years later in 1999, Montenegro decided that both the Yugoslav dinar and the Deutsche Mark would be its official currency. In addition, in November 2000, Montenegro dropped the dinar.\"\n\nThis suggests that the Yugoslav dinar was still used by Montenegro in 1999, but it was not their only currency, and they eventually adopted the Euro in 2002 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9318/re-ranker-msmarco/38.txt). Therefore, the statement that the currency of Republic of Montenegro (1992-2006) is Yugoslav dinar does not hold true."

The query specifically asks about the period from 1992 to 2006, which is within the timeframe of the Yugoslav dinar's use in Yugoslavia and by extension, Montenegro during that period."
