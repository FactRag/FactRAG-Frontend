Several documents explicitly mention Joyce Manor being part of the emo-revival movement or describe their music as having emo characteristics. \n* **Triple Evaluation:** The query asks if the genre of \"Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired\" is Emo. Based on the document analysis, this statement aligns with the information presented.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other triples you'd like me to evaluate!"

The text does describe the band's earlier work as having a \"blistering punk sound\" on their eponymous debut (2011) and follow-up Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired (2012), but it also describes later works, such as Never Hungover Again, as blending pop-punk and indie rock influences. Therefore, the correctness of the triple is \"no\"."
