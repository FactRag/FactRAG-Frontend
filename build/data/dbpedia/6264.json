Additionally, the document `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6264/re-ranker-msmarco/60.txt` mentions that Doug Turner lives in Atlanta, GA; however, since the query specifically asks about his residence in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and there is no conflicting information in other documents suggesting otherwise, we can conclude that he resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico."
