This supports the triple statement that Sir Ralph Verney, 1st Baronet, of Middle Claydon was indeed born in Buckinghamshire."

This supports the statement that Sir Ralph Verney, 1st Baronet, was born in Buckinghamshire, though his exact birthplace is not explicitly stated, the context strongly implies he had strong ties to the area."
