The context also mentions that the Separate Baptist movement in the South established itself first in north-central North Carolina as a result of the coming to that area in 1755 of a small colony of Baptists from Connecticut.\n\nAdditionally, while it is true that the Great Awakening began in the 1730s, the documents do not specify that New England was where it started. The Separate Baptists are mentioned as emerging from this movement, but their specific roots and location are discussed in more detail later on."
