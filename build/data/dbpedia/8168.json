This suggests that it is indeed correct that Zuleica Wilson was born in Angola."

While the specific document does not explicitly state where she was born, it strongly implies her nationality and origin as Angola through various references to her participating in local and national pageants within Angola. Therefore, the statement \"Zuleica Wilson was born in Angola\" can be considered supported by the context provided."
