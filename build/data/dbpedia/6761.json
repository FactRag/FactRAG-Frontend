Specifically, they mention his involvement in diplomatic missions, such as traveling to Prague with W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagiellon (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6761/re-ranker-msmarco/17.txt), accompanying the latter's negotiations with Bohemia and Hungary (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6761/re-ranker-msmarco/17.txt), and being sent on a diplomatic mission to Matthias Corvinus to help bring about peace between Poland and Hungary in 1478 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6761/re-ranker-msmarco/17.txt).\n\nThese mentions suggest that Jan D\u0142ugosz indeed had diplomatic roles and activities, supporting the triple \"Jan D\u0142ugosz was a diplomat\"."
