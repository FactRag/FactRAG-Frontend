In fact, one document mentions that the Tappan-Kittle Covered Bridge is located over Dry Brook in the Catskill Mountains, while another document refers to a different covered bridge called \"Forge Covered Bridge\" which crosses Dry Brook. However, there is no mention of a specific bridge called \"Tappan Bridge\" and its association with Dry Brook."
