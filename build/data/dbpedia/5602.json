Given his contributions to film and the recognition he received (as evidenced by his roles such as president of the American Guild of Directors and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences), it's reasonable to infer that he would be included in such a category. However, for absolute certainty, one would need explicit mention or a direct reference to him receiving this specific award."

Therefore, without additional verification from outside sources, we cannot confirm this statement.\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that external knowledge reveals Robert Wise indeed received the United States National Medal of Arts in 1987, but since the context does not provide this information, based solely on the given documents, the answer is no."
