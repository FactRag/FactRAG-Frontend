While there are mentions of him being an al-Qaeda operative and having connections to Pakistani intelligence services, his actual membership in this category is not directly confirmed."

For example, multiple sources mention his association with the group and his involvement in various activities related to al-Qaeda. Therefore, categorizing him as a \"Pakistani al-Qaeda member\" is supported by the given context."
