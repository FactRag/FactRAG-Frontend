While the Neo-Assyrian Empire had its capital at Nineveh for a significant period, the documents suggest that Assur was an important city and possibly the capital of earlier forms of the Assyrian empire, making it likely to be considered as part of the broader context of Assyrian history and culture."

For instance:\n\n- From `40.txt`: \"Assur was likely the first (it's where the name Assyria comes from).\"\n- From `62.txt`: \"Ashur (on the Tigris River in northern Iraq) was the first capital of Assyria.\"\n- Additional details about Assur as a religious and important center suggest its significance as one of the capitals, particularly before the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nWhile it is noted that the capital moved to Calah (modern-day Nimrud) and then Nineveh during the Neo-Assyrian period, the documents still confirm Assur's early importance."
