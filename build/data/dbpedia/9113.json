However, this does not explicitly state that the currency is Pound sterling. A closer look at the document reveals that it mentions \"NIGERIA (British)\" as a former British colony on the West coast of Africa, with a currency consisting of pounds and shillings, but it doesn't mention Niger Coast Protectorate specifically. The only mention of pound is in the context of Nigeria, not Niger Coast Protectorate.\n\nAdditionally, in another document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9113/re-ranker-msmarco/5.txt, it mentions that \"The West African Pound remained current during the colonial rule.\" However, this does not necessarily mean that Niger Coast Protectorate used the same currency as Nigeria or other parts of British West Africa."

Although it does not explicitly state \"Pound sterling,\" given the context within British colonial territories and the currency systems described, it is reasonable to infer that Pound sterling was used in practice for such protectorates."

However, it does state that \"Currency 12 pence = 1 shilling; 20 shillings = 1 pound.\" This suggests that the protectorate used a currency system equivalent to the Pound Sterling.\n\nGiven this indirect evidence and considering the context of other colonial currencies discussed in the documents, we can infer but cannot confirm with certainty that the Niger Coast Protectorate's currency was directly Pound Sterling. However, since the question is asking for direct support from the documents, we must answer based on explicit statements rather than inference.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{\"output\": \"no\"}"

It also states that the member states included Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria, and The Gambia, which later became independent countries.  Furthermore, the text mentions the establishment of the West African Currency Board in 1912, which issued a unique set of sterling coinage for use in British West Africa.   This strongly suggests a unified currency system across British West African territories, including the Niger Coast Protectorate.",
