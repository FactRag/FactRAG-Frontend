Additionally, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian ruble was introduced and became the official currency of Russia, while also being used informally in other countries. The documents do not mention any other currencies being used by the Soviet Union.\n\nSo, based on the provided context information, the triple \"The currency of Soviet Union is Soviet ruble\" is indeed supported."
