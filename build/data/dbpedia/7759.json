While there are no explicit mentions of Eryue He writing in the genre of Historical fiction, the context suggests that his works often dealt with historical periods and events, such as the Qing Dynasty and the Sino-Japanese War.\n\nFor example, one document mentions \"Dream of Going Back to the Qing Dynasty\" as a novel that explores the brutal fights for rights of succession among the sons of Kang Xi, fourth emperor of Qing Dynasty. This suggests that Eryue He's works may have been set in historical periods and contexts, which is consistent with the genre of Historical fiction.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, it appears to support the triple \"Eryue He writes in the genre of Historical fiction\"."
