Johnston\" who has a different profession and accomplishments, but it does not contradict the information in the first three documents.\n* The fifth document mentions another person named \"Philip Johnston\" who was accused of involvement in money laundering, which again implies that this person's official name is indeed \"Philip Johnston\".\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided, I conclude that:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
