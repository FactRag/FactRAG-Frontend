However, it does not directly state that Al Murray works in musical theatre.\n\nBut considering Document 1, I can say that the triple is partially supported by the information in the documents, because there are mentions of a musical production written by Al Murray, but no clear connection to musical theatre as his genre.\n\nSo, my answer would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"partially\"\n}\n```\nBut since you asked for \"yes\" or \"no\", I'll give you the most accurate response based on the available information.\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
