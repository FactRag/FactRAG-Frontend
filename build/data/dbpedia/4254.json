This implies that Rusnano is a company related to the nanotechnology field.\n\nFurthermore, there are several references throughout the documents that mention Rusnano's mission, role, and activities in the context of nanotechnology, such as:\n\n* \"RUSNANO was established in March 2011 as an open joint-stock company through reorganization of state corporation Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies.\"\n* \"RUSNANO's mission is to develop the Russian nanotechnology industry through co-investment in nanotechnology projects with substantial economic potential or social benefit.\"\n* \"Frost & Sullivan recognizes RUSNANO with the 2015 Frost & Sullivan Award for Enabling Technology Leadership in Russia, citing its role in transforming scientific developments in nanotechnology to commercial businesses.\"\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Rusnano indeed falls under the category of nanotechnology companies. Therefore, the answer is \"yes\"."
