Williams was the sixth General Relief Society President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"\n\t+ This confirms that Clarissa S. Williams exists and held a notable position.\n* However, upon further examination:\n\t+ Document 2 mentions \"Clarissa Smith Williams\" as a daughter of William Nugent Williams and Clarissa West Smith.\n\t+ Documents 3, 5, and 6 mention different individuals with the name \"Clarissa\" or variations thereof (e.g., Clariscy, Clarissa Slaughter, Clarissa Smith Williams), but none explicitly confirm that \"Clarissa S. Williams\" is the full name of a notable individual mentioned in Document 1.\n\t+ Documents 4 and 7 seem unrelated to the person mentioned in Document 1.\n\nGiven this analysis, I conclude that:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThe statement \"The full name of Clarissa S. Williams is Williams, Clarissa S.\" is not supported by the provided documents, as they do not explicitly confirm that the individual mentioned in Document 1 has the full name \"Clarissa S.
