In fact, the first document mentions someone named \"Hidayat Orujov\" as a writer and theater figure, while the second document mentions a person named \"Hidayat Orujov Khudush Oglu\", who is an Azerbaijani politician. There is no indication that these two individuals are the same person, or that Hidayat Orujov's full name is indeed \"Hidayat Orujov\"."
