However, none of them explicitly state that it is a subdivision of New York.\n* In fact, some documents suggest that Wayland might be an independent entity, as they provide separate information about its population, location, and administrative procedures.\n* The only mention of a subdivision-like structure is in the document \"/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_42/re-ranker-msmarco/5.txt\", where it says \"The Town of Wayland is located in the state of New York, in Steuben County.\" However, this does not imply that Wayland (the village) is a subdivision of New York.\n* Therefore, based on the provided context, I conclude that the information in the documents does not support the triple."
