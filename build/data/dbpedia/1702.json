However, there is no information that links the \"Troublemaker\" album to Weezer.\n* Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be confirmed whether the album \"Troublemaker\" is indeed by Weezer.\n\nNote: The mention of Weezer in one article does not provide enough evidence to support the triple."
