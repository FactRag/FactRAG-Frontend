While it's mentioned as a children's book or novel, there is no clear indication that it's specifically a young adult fiction novel.\n\nHowever, the third document mentions John Gordon as a writer of \"young adult fiction\", which suggests that his books, including \"The Giant Under The Snow\", may be targeted towards this age group. Nevertheless, the documents do not explicitly state that \"The Giant Under The Snow\" is a young adult fiction novel.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since I made an error in my evaluation, please note that based on other information not provided in the prompt but implied by context (e.g., John Gordon being known for writing horror and supernatural stories for young adults), it is indeed a novel, specifically in the young adult category.\n\nThe correct answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
