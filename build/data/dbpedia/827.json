However, this suggests that Lovin & Withers, Inc. was responsible for building the house, not designing houses.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, there is no evidence to support the claim that Lovin and Withers Cottages were designed by Lovin & Withers, Inc., hence the output is \"no\"."
