This can be inferred from statements such as \"Gen Kheirbek is a member of the Alawite Kalabiya tribe\" and \"Their families are also connected by marriage - a relative is married to one of Rifaat al-Assad's daughters.\""

Issam Zahreddine, who was related to Kheirbek and played significant roles in Syria's security apparatus, had an Alawite background. Additionally, Kheirbek himself is described as having close ties with the Alawite family and serving in key positions under Assad regimes.
