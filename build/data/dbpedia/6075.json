This implies that there was a whip imposed by the party leader or someone else, but it doesn't mention David Cameron as the one imposing the whip.\n* The second document provides biographical information about David Cameron, but it doesn't mention anything about him being his own public whip.\n* The third and fourth documents (which are identical) report on allegations that some Conservative backbenchers have abused their expenses system. They also mention that David Cameron was considering removing the Conservative whip from these individuals, which implies that he has control over the party whip. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that he is his own public whip.\n* The fifth document reports on a cabinet reshuffle and mentions that Andrew will be the chief whip. This implies that there is someone else in charge of the party whip, not David Cameron himself.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that the information in the documents does not strongly support the statement \"David Cameron is his own public whip.\" The only hint of control over the party whip comes from the fact that he was considering removing it from certain individuals. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that he has direct authority over the public whip.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"

The documents mention \"chief whip\" roles and the authority to remove party whips, but there's no indication that Cameron holds this position himself or performs these functions personally."
