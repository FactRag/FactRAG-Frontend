It was based on a popular stage play starring the fabulous Rosalind Russell, who reprised her role in the film.\"\n* The document with file_path \"/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3101/re-ranker-msmarco/52.txt\" states that \"The stories are mostly fictional, but he wanted to make them sound true so he used the character\u2019s name as a pen name (the author\u2019s real name was Edward Everett Tanner III and Auntie Mame was loosely based on an actual aunt he had). In 1958, a film titled Auntie Mame, based on the play, was released by Warner Brothers once again starring Rosalind Russell in the title role.\"\n* The document with file_path \"/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3101/re-ranker-msmarco/54.txt\" states that \"The popular novel, Broadway play, and movie depicted the experience of Patrick, a rich orphan who comes to live with his eccentric aunt.\"\n\nBased on these documents, it is clear that the film \"Auntie Mame\" was indeed based on a stage play, which in turn was adapted from a novel.
