It always pleasantly amuses me that David Sadie and Donovan Rall are surely the two most towering, large-framed men in Swartland wine (they could scrum down together very satisfactorily I\u2019d guess) and yet make amongst the most refinedly delicate of Swartland wines.\n\n A word though, for many other red blends made according to the non-interventionist, terroir-respecting SIP guidelines.  Including Badenhorst Red \u2013 the 2014 is the best yet of the flagship blends from this fine house.  Winemaker there alongside Adi Badenhorst is Jasper Wickens, who also makes smallish runs of utterly delightful and fresh but deadly serious wine for his own admirable label, Swerwer.  I chatted to both Jasper and wholly supportive Adi about the former\u2019s future at AA Badenhorst winery.\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2113/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt\n\nWinemaker there alongside Adi Badenhorst is Jasper Wickens, who also makes smallish runs of utterly delightful and fresh but deadly serious wine for his own admirable label, Swerwer.  I chatted to both Jasper and wholly supportive Adi about the former\u2019s future at AA Badenhorst winery.  Slowly, but unhurriedly, it seems, Jasper will build up his independent winery (he\u2019s renovating an old cellar on a nearby grape-farm owned by the family of his fianc\u00e9e, Franciska) and will do less at Badenhorst; but no change for a while yet.\n\n As to grenache blanc, the variety gives me no excuse to mention the Mullineux White Blend 2014 (chenin, clairette, viognier and semillon gris have to manage alone) as the standout white of the 2016 SIP tasting, so I won\u2019t.  And for a concluding varietal white grenache I\u2019ll move away from the Swartland, up north to Piekenierskloof, which provided the grapes for Donovan Rall\u2019s maiden Grenache Blanc 2015.\n\n As I couldn\u2019t be allowed to sample this produce of foreign soil there in Malmesbury, Donovan slipped me a bottle as I was leaving (the rock music was ramping up the volume \u2013 I suspect it was a mechanism to prompt old curmudgeons to move to the exit).  It\u2019s a rather good wine, if not with great intensity and length \u2013 worth seeking out, though only 1200 bottles were made, apparently.\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2113/re-ranker-msmarco/43.txt\n\nProduct Description\n\nHotMix return with the famous \u2018Underground Dance\u2019 various artists.

The most sought after (and occasionally fought-over) Cape grenache comes from the lovely Piekenierskloof area in the Olifantsriver district, where it is best established, but new plantings are happening everywhere, especially in the Swartland, where the grape has been particularly warmly embraced.  White mono-varietal bottlings are rarer \u2013 the most notable are those of The Foundry, the fine own-label of Meerlust winemaker Chris Williams (plus wine-partner James Reid), and KWV\u2019s Mentors range.  Of a new challenger to them, more below.\n\n But it was the effect of grenache noir as a blending partner that I was particularly struck by at Saturday\u2019s unsurprisingly impressive public tasting in Malmesbury of the Swartland Independent Producers (SIP) \u2013 despite the undoubted greatness of David & Nadie Sadie\u2019s David Grenache (not available for tasting).  The David Elpidios has grenache in a subsidiary role, which is much more typical of Swartland blends, where it frequently accompanies syrah, cinsaut and carignan.\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2113/re-ranker-msmarco/60.txt\n\nAccording to Larisa Grollemond, an art historian and curator of medieval manuscripts at the Getty Museum, the name reinforces a stereotype of the medieval millennium as \u201ca time of sickness, of plague, of a stagnation in art and culture.\u201d But, Grollemond said, the so-called Dark Ages were also marked by the rise of universities, mechanical clocks, the printing press, astrolabes, crop rotation, and mead.  \u201cI think there\u2019s darkness about every age,\u201d she continued.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very human thing to want to find yourself in history.  I don\u2019t think we will ever stop periodizing.\u201d\n\nThe urge to name reflects the urge to understand.  In February, Liz Lenkinski, a social strategist in Los Angeles, began referring to our era as the Age of Unhingement in conversations with friends.  The phrase stuck, and she started an Unhingement-themed newsletter.  \u201cIt makes me feel saner to talk about it,\u201d Lenkinski told me.\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2113/re-ranker-msmarco/60.txt\n\n\u201cIn history, humans as animals have lived in uncertainty and helplessness, but we haven\u2019t had it demonstrated to us on a minute-by-minute basis.  It\u2019s hard psychologically to deal with it,\u201d Bridle told me.  In the past few years, the term \u201cnew dark age\u201d has been used to encompass the decay of democracy and the increasingly blatant impact of climate change.  The name represents \u201ca time of sickness, of plague, of a stagnation in art and culture.\u201d  But, Grollemond said, the so-called Dark Ages were also marked by the rise of universities, mechanical clocks, the printing press, astrolabes, crop rotation, and mead.\n\n The label of KZLE is 'KZLE'.\n```\n\nTriple: ?\n\nBased on the context information provided:\n\n* The answer to \"The label of KZLE is 'KZLE'.\" is given as yes.\n \nSo for this query: \n\nQuery: The label of KZLE is 'KZLE'.\n\nAnswer: {'output': 'yes'}"
