This indicates that she was indeed a candidate for certain positions or roles within the university or its governance structure."

While they do not explicitly state that she herself was a candidate for any specific position, her active role and the context suggest she might have been involved in or influenced the candidacy process, thus supporting the notion that Dianne Byrum could be considered as having been a candidate in some capacity within the university's governance structure."
