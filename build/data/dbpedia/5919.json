This suggests that the leadership structure of Derby is more specific than just \"Local government in England\", which is a broader category.\n* The documents also mention various leaders and officials, such as Councillor Chris Poulter (in document 113), who is described as the Leader of Derby City Council. This further supports the idea that the leader title of Derby is not simply \"Local government in England\".\n* Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that the triple is incorrect, and the value should be \"no\"."
