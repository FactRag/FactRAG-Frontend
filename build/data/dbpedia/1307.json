In fact, one of the documents explicitly states that the title track to Give the People What They Want was written by Ray Davies in response to what he saw on American TV when writing songs for their previous album, Low Budget.\n* The correct interpretation of the song's meaning is based on the context provided in the documents, which suggests that it is about sensationalism and the audience's desire for thrilling content."

While they do not explicitly state that it is about the band's songs, the context provided discusses several of their songwriting techniques and themes, which indirectly supports this statement. Therefore, based on the given documents, the response to whether \"Give the People What They Want (The Kinks song) is about The Kinks' songs\" can be considered valid (\"yes\")."
