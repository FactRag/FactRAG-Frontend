The first document does mention that Wells Fargo is headquartered in San Francisco, which implies that the company has a presence in the United States, but it doesn't specify the country where it was founded.\n\nHowever, based on historical context, it's reasonable to infer that Wells Fargo was indeed founded in the United States (specifically California) during the California Gold Rush era. But strictly speaking, this information is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. Therefore, I must respond with \"no\" according to the given format."
