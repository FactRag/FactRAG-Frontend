Specifically, the document labeled as `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1746/re-ranker-msmarco/58.txt` mentions two individuals named Stuart: Edwin Sydney (1853-1937) and Eugene P. Stuart.\n\nHowever, only one of them is mentioned to be buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery: Edwin Sydney Stuart. The document states that \"Died March 21, 1937 (age 83 years, 83 days).
