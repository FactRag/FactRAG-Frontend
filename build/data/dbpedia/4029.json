However, one of the documents mentions that the original church was constructed in the 10th century on the northern tower of the fortress of Babylon, which is likely referring to the same location. Therefore, the statement that \"The Church of St. George in Cairo was constructed in 10\" seems supported by the information provided.\n\nNote: The answer would be different if we were evaluating the triple \"The Church of St. George in Cairo was built after the year 1900\", which would be 'yes' as the documents mention that a new church was built in 1904."

This aligns with the query stating it was constructed in the 10th century, hence the answer is \"yes.\""
