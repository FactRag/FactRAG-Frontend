Specifically, the document mentioning `1.txt` states, \"L\u00e9on Walras (1874), who had read Cournot's work early on, argued that his own theory was but a multi-market generalization of Cournot's partial equilibrium model.\" This supports the influence of L\u00e9on Walras by Antoine Augustin Cournot."
