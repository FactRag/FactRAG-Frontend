It\u2019s not a good movie.\"\n* Document 19: This document provides more information on The Swap, its release year (2016), but also mentions that it's based on a young adult novel of the same name written by Megan Shull.\n* Document 36: Although this document is about a different version of The Swap released in 2016 for Disney Channel, there is no mention of Jordan Leondopoulos or any connection to Sam's Song.\n\nHowever, the other documents do not provide information on the exact abstract of The Swap. \n\nDocument 8 states that \"Sam's Song is in fact a finished movie\" but does not directly connect it to an abstract for The Swap.\n\nDocument 37 mentions Jordan Leondopolous as the director of both Sam's Song and The Swap, but this connection seems indirect when considering the question about the abstract.\n\nDocument 19 provides context on the Disney Channel release of The Swap in 2016. There is no direct information provided about an abstract for a 1979 version of The Swap directed by Jordan Leondopolous.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would say that there is insufficient information to definitively confirm or deny the given abstract as being accurate based solely on the documents provided.\n\n\nTherefore, my evaluation will be: \n\n```json\n{\n    \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
