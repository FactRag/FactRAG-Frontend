In fact, one document mentions that the Iban language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian family, which suggests that it is a distinct language from Indonesian (which is an Austronesian language). Another document mentions that the Iban language is closely related to Malay, but there is no mention of Indonesian specifically."

However, they do not explicitly state that the Iban people speak Indonesian; rather, they indicate that the Iban language is distinct from Malay but related to it. Therefore, the statement \"The Iban people speak Indonesian\" is not supported by the given documents."
