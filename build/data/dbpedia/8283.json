In fact, the text describes the St. Louis Car Company as manufacturing aircrafts during World War I as a subcontractor to Curtiss, but there is no indication that this is part of a larger corporation called St. Louis Aircraft Corporation. Therefore, based on the provided context information, it cannot be determined whether the statement is true or false, but the available evidence suggests that it is not supported by the documents."
