This is close to the year 39, but it's not exactly what you're looking for since it doesn't match the name \"Vilhelmina\".\n* There are other documents mentioning people with the first name \"Vilhelmina\", such as \"Vilhelmina I Szabo\" who was born in 1937 and \"Alina Vilhelmina Johnson\" (also known as Alina) who was born in 1884. None of these mentions a birth year close to 39.\n\nHowever, none of the documents mention a person named \"Vilhelmina\" being born exactly in 39, so the answer is \"no\"."
