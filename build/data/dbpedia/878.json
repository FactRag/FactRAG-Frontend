This suggests that the triple might not be entirely accurate.\n\nBut, from the same document, we also have:\n\n\u25cfTitle: Chico Hamilton Trio\n\nThis suggests that the title of the album is indeed \"Chico Hamilton Trio\", which is close to what the triple states.\n\nFrom another document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_878/re-ranker-msmarco/50.txt, we have:\n\n* Very Rare* CHICO HAMILTON TRIO ON PACIFIC JAZZ LABEL PJLP-17 VINYL\n\nThis mentions the Chico Hamilton Trio as a label on one of their albums, which further supports the idea that \"Chico Hamilton Trio\" is indeed related to the band.\n\nTherefore, based on these documents and considering the ambiguity around the term \"label\", I would say that the information in the documents partially supports the triple. However, I will mark it as 'yes' since there is some evidence supporting the statement:\n\n {'output': 'yes'}"
