However, they don't specify the exact number of agencies.\n- The documents also mention that Mid-City CAN serves \"the San Diego comunity of City Heights\" (document 51.txt) and later specify it as a community collaborative centered in the \"City Heights Community\" (documents 33.txt and 14.txt), which aligns with part of the comment. However, they don't specifically list all the mentioned neighborhoods.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that while the document information supports some parts of the provided comment, there might be slight variations or omissions in terms of specific details like the number of agencies and additional neighborhoods served. Therefore:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'yes' (with some caveats)}"
