Quintanilla III is mentioned as a songwriter and producer of \"Techno Cumbia\", the documents also mention that Pete Astudillo wrote down the concept of the song, implying co-authorship or contribution to its composition. Therefore, stating that A.B. Quintanilla III alone is the writer of \"Techno Cumbia\" is not entirely accurate according to the provided context information."
