Namboodiripad's birth and early life, they do not provide any information about him being born in Presidencies and provinces of British India. Instead, they mention that he was born on June 13, 1909, at Elamkulam, Perinthalmanna taluk, Malappuram, Kerala, India."

Namboodiripad's birthplace, stating that he was born on June 13, 1909, in Perinthalmanna, Kerala, India. While the term \"Presidencies and provinces of British India\" is a broad geographical designation, Kerala can be considered part of such an administrative division during British rule, thus supporting the statement that E.M.S. Namboodiripad was born in Presidencies and provinces of British India."
