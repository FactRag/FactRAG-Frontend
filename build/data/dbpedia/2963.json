In fact, one of the documents mentions that there were different versions of the story \"Queen of Spades\", which is another work by Aleksandr Pushkin, and one of them was made into a film in 1916 by Yakov Protazanov, but it does not mention anything about \"A Pistol Shot\". Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be confirmed that \"A Pistol Shot\" is indeed based on a work by Aleksandr Pushkin."
