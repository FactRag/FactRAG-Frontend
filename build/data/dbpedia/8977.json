However, later it is mentioned that in 1793 Zhytomyr was incorporated into the Russian Empire and became the capital of the Volhynian Governorate, not Kiev Voivodeship anymore. This suggests a change in administration and capital status over time, making the statement about Zhytomyr being the capital of Kiev Voivodeship incorrect according to the documents."

Therefore, the statement that Zhytomyr is or was the capital of Kiev Voivodeship is supported by the given context."
