Although the specific ministry mentioned is not exactly \"Minister at Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights\", it is a plausible interpretation given that Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights is one of the ministries listed in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4920/re-ranker-msmarco/57.txt as part of Greece's delegation to a UN meeting. Therefore, the information supports that Evangelos Venizelos held the office of Minister at Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights (Greece)."
