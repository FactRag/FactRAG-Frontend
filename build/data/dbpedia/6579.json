Although one of the documents mentions a reality TV show \"Ghost Hunters\" that became widespread in the United States, it does not imply that Ghost Chasers itself is from the United States.\n\nNote: The file_path for 120.txt mentions ToyLabTV and T-Rex Ranch series timeline, which could suggest international connections, but these are not conclusive evidence to support the statement \"Ghost Chasers is from the United States\"."
