However, given that he became Duke of Poland and had Polish parents (Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman and Judith of Bohemia), it is more likely that he was born in Poland. The fact that the claim states \"without your knowledge\" implies you did not know this specific detail, but based on historical context, it can be reasonably inferred that his birthplace was Poland. Since no direct contradiction to his Polish birth is provided, and considering his role as Duke of Poland, the most logical conclusion is that he was born in Poland. Therefore, if there's a certainty that he was not born in Poland, additional evidence would be needed to support this claim; otherwise, the statement can be considered incorrect based on the lack of supporting information for his birthplace being outside Poland.",
