In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6306/re-ranker-msmarco/15.txt, it says: \"I want to start a listing of prop manufactures that will make a prop that can be used on a VW powered Sonerai. Please add to the list... Sterba Propellers (whatever size and pitch you want)\"\n2. In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6306/re-ranker-msmarco/128.txt, it says: \"Catto Propellers has been providing cutting edge technology and high-quality manufacturing services for close to 50 years... At Catto Propellers we design and manufacture propellers for experimental, S-LSA and E-LSA aircraft. However, there is no information about Sterba Propellers in this document.\"\n\nHowever, since the first mention of Sterba Propellers does not necessarily imply that it only produces propellers (aircraft), we cannot conclude with certainty that the triple is correct based solely on the provided context.\n\nAfter re-examining the documents, I found another mention of Sterba Propellers in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6306/re-ranker-msmarco/15.txt, where it says \"Sterba Propellers (whatever size and pitch you want)\" which implies that they do produce propellers.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
