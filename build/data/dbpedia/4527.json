The text also states that the operation was used to disrupt democratic elections and smears campaign the left, which suggests that paramilitary methods were indeed used.\n\nThe specific phrases \"mobilizing paramilitary fascist indigenous elements\" (from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4527/re-ranker-msmarco/71.txt) and \"harassment of left-wing parties, torture, terrorist attacks, and massacres\" (from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4527/re-ranker-msmarco/32.txt) further support this conclusion."
