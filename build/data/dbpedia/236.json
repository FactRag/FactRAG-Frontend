The second document is about the 1942 film \"Mr. Wise Guy\", which was distributed by Monogram Pictures, not First National Pictures.\n3. The third document mentions a new title for an upcoming Robert De Niro mob movie as \"Wise Guys\", but it does not specify that it's related to First National Pictures films.\n4. The fourth document describes the plot of \"Wise Guys\" (now titled Alto Knights), which is about two crime bosses, but again, no mention of First National Pictures films.\n\nBased on this analysis, none of the documents provide information that would support the triple: \"The Wise Guy is about Category:First National Pictures films.\"\n\nTherefore, the response should be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
