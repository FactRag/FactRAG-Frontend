By late 1989, they were touring nationally and appeared with many well-known groups and musicians, which implies that their home base or hometown is indeed in the United States, specifically in the region of Virginia, the Carolinas, and the Washington DC area."

Indecision is described as a band formed in 1993 in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn, New York, which is within the United States. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hometown of Indecision (band) is the United States."
