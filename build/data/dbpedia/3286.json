While it is true that Spider-Man meets the Counter-Earth version of the Green Goblin and they team up to save Dr. Naoko Yamada-Jones, the events leading to their alliance are not just about stopping a plan by her kidnappers responsible for the green Bio-Mass: Venom and Carnage. The story also involves Spider-Man joining a rebellion against the High Evolutionary, moving in with a single mother and her son, and dealing with other characters like Vulture and X-51. Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the plot by focusing on one particular incident without considering the broader context of the series.",
