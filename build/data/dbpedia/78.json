In fact, one document mentions \u00d6stersund Ski Stadium and another mentions Ostersund\u2019s ice hockey arena and ski stadium in reference to Jamtkraft Arena, without mentioning a ballpark.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, I conclude that the statement \"The ballpark of \u00d6stersunds BS is \u00d6stersund Arena\" is not supported."
