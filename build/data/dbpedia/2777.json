However, it does not explicitly state that Valis II is about Category: Sega Genesis games. In fact, one of the files (63.txt) specifically states that \"The Sega Genesis didn\u2019t technically get Valis II\", suggesting that the game was not originally developed for the Sega Genesis.\n\nHowever, another file (85.txt) mentions a collection called \"Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection II\" which includes Syd of Valis (a remake of Valis II) as one of its games. This suggests that while Valis II may not have been originally released on the Sega Genesis, its remakes or related games were."
