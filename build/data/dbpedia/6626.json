The triple statement in question is: \"The video game Exit was developed by Taito Corporation.\"\n\nFrom the provided context, we can see that the original Taito Corporation was involved in developing games such as Space Invaders and Arkanoid. Later on, a second company with the name \"Taito Corporation\" (formerly known as SQEX/Game Designers Studio) emerged, but it is mentioned to have been spun off into a separate entity called Taito Soft Corporation after merging with ES1 Corporation to become the new Taito Corporation.\n\nHowever, another document mentions that \"The company's American publishing branch, Taito America, published their home console titles in North America until 1996...\", which implies that there was indeed an original Taito Corporation involved in game development and publishing.\n\nAdditionally, a separate file (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6626/re-ranker-msmarco/33.txt) contains information about the video game Exit, stating that it was \"published and developed originally by Taito for the PlayStation Portable.\"\n\nTherefore, based on this context, it can be inferred that the original Taito Corporation was involved in developing games, including possibly Exit. Hence, the statement is supported by the provided documents.\n\nNote: The answer would have been different if there were direct evidence contradicting the triple or if the context did not support the original Taito Corporation being responsible for game development."
