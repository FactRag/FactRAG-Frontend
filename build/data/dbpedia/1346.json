This suggests that Masashi Hamauzu did indeed compose music for Final Fantasy XIII, even if it wasn't originally intended.\n* Another document mentions the track list for the original soundtrack of Final Fantasy XIII, which was composed by Masashi Hamauzu.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I conclude that:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}"
