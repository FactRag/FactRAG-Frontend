(file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2913/re-ranker-msmarco/20.txt)\n* They also mention that Meggitt's civil aerospace presence covers large commercial transports, regional aircraft, business jets, helicopters, and general aviation. (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2913/re-ranker-msmarco/20.txt and 35.txt)\n* Furthermore, the documents state that Meggitt has dominated the aerospace industry for almost half a century and that there's scarcely an aeroplane in service that doesn't carry Meggitt's critical components and smart systems. (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2913/re-ranker-msmarco/35.txt)\n\nBased on this information, I conclude that the triple \"Meggitt is in the aerospace industry\" is indeed supported by the documents.\n\nHere's my response in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
