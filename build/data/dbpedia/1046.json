However, it does not explicitly state that the Chief of Navy is always an admiral. In fact, the document mentions that Admiral Chris Barrie AC RAN (1998) held the rank of admiral due to serving as the Chief of the Defence Force, but it does not imply that all Chiefs of Navy are admirals. Therefore, the triple \"Chief of Navy (Australia)\" being equivalent to \"Category: Royal Australian Navy admirals\" is not supported by the documents."
