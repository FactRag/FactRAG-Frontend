Burroughs the \u201cgreatest satirical writer since Jonathan Swift\u201d, which suggests that Burroughs was influenced by Swift's writing style or satire, rather than being a direct influence on him. However, this phrase is used in the context of praising Burroughs' work as a satirical writer, implying that he was influenced by Swift's ideas or techniques, even if it's not explicitly stated that he was directly inspired by Swift.\n\nAnother passage mentions Mary McCarthy comparing William S Burroughs to Jonathan Swift, noting a like-minded \u201csoured optimism\u201d, but this comparison is made in the context of discussing Burroughs' own work and style, rather than suggesting that Burroughs was influenced by Swift. \n\nGiven these points, I believe that the information in the documents supports the triple that William S. Burroughs was influenced by Jonathan Swift."
