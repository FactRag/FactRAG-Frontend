Instead, the context suggests that Hey Girl is a girl group involved in music (as evidenced by their albums and singles), but it does not explicitly state that each member of the group sings individually. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot confirm that \"Hey Girl (group) is a singer\" as a standalone statement without additional supporting evidence."
