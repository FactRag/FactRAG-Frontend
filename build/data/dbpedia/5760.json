Specifically, document `32.txt` mentions an adventurous gravel route that includes a visit to both Thunstetten and Langenthal, suggesting they are nearby locations. Additionally, while the exact distance is not given in all documents, document `68.txt` provides specific distances between these towns (Langenthal being 3 kilometers west of Castle Tchunztetten, with Thunstetten mentioned as part of this route). This supports the notion that Langenthal and Thunstetten are neighboring municipalities."
