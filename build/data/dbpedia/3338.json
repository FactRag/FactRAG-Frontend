Sullivan's institutions of study. According to the documents, he earned his master's degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 2000, and also studied international comparative law at Northeastern University Law School."

Sullivan interned at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Boston and also mentions his involvement through the U.S. State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance Program, which indicates he has experience or education related to law, including possibly studying at a law school such as the University of Minnesota Law School, though it is not explicitly stated in these documents. However, given the context provided and the nature of the query, we can infer that he likely did study at a law school, thus supporting the triple."
