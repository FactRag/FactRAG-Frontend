However, none of the documents directly mention the book \"To Be a Lady\" or its language. The content does not provide specific information about the authorship or language of this particular book. Nonetheless, based on the general context that discusses terms used in English, one could infer that \"To Be a Lady,\" being a book, is written in English, which aligns with the statement in question.
