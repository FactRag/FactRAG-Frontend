Hire more reporters; we can get national and international news online.\" It then describes The Enquirer as a tabloid, but it also mentions that the current format of Cincinnati CityBeat (which they're comparing to) is already narrower than the traditional broadsheet.\n* While there's no explicit statement about Cincinnati CityBeat being a tabloid, the description in Document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2017/re-ranker-msmarco/18.txt (\"As a free weekly newspaper...\") implies that it has a print format similar to The Enquirer's (which is described as tabloid), suggesting that the answer is \"yes\"."
