I look to the king', which has become a sort of war cry for us. This does not imply any collaboration with Ingram on this particular instance.\n* There is no explicit mention of Jacob Sooter working with Jason Ingram (which is how \"Ingram\" might be related to the song).\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, I conclude that there is insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the statement \"As Long as It Takes was written by Jacob Sooter Ingram\".\n\nHowever, given your request for a structured JSON output, I'll provide:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"

However, since only Jacob Sooter's name is provided and not specifically with Jason Ingram, we should clarify that they are mentioned together in context but need explicit confirmation of their joint authorship for absolute certainty.
