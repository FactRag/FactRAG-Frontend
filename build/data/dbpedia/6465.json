For example, from the document `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6465/re-ranker-msmarco/14.txt`, we see \"Adelaide Metro began in 2000 with the privatisation of existing government-operated bus and train routes. The Glenelg tram, the only of Adelaide's tramways to survive the 1950s, was also integrated into the current system.\" This indicates that services previously under TransAdelaide were integrated or taken over by Adelaide Metro, supporting the statement that the successor of TransAdelaide is indeed Adelaide Metro."
