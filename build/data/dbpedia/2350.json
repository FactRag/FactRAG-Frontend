This implies that the book is of literary significance, but it does not explicitly state that it belongs to the category Danish books.\n* However, considering the context of the document (Danish articles, a person named Michelle Hviid who has written about Danish topics), it's reasonable to infer that \"Uden m\u00e5l \u2013 og med\" is likely a Danish book.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!"
