While the exact wording for the query about the label of Gangakhed is not present, the documents do support that clothing labels are produced in Gangakhed by mentioning multiple product categories intended for use as labels or tags. Thus, it can be inferred that \"The label of Gangakhed\" in this context refers to the clothing labels produced there, supporting the statement with the given information."
