However, the category \"American businesspeople\" might be too narrow, as the documents also mention her as a madam or operator of an escort agency (files 24, 20). Therefore, while it is true that she was convicted of crimes and fits into the broader category of being involved in business activities related to prostitution, the specific categorization \"American businesspeople\" might not fully capture her role as a madam or owner of an escort service."
