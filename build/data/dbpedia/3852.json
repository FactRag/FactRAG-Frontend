The main focus of the documents is on the war between North and South Korea, and the involvement of other countries like the Philippines seems to be a secondary aspect.\n\nThe text does not suggest that the Korean War was primarily about wars involving the Philippines. In fact, one document mentions that the Philippines \"deployed five (5) Battalion Combat Teams with more than 7,400 personnel as part of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea\" which implies that their involvement was as a contributing force in the broader conflict between North and South Korea."
