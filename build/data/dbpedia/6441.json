The film is an adaptation of the 1869 novel Lorna Doone by R. D. Blackmore, set in Seventeenth century Devon.\"\n\n\n* **Therefore:** This clearly indicates that the 1912 film is based on a novel.  \n\nSince \"Category: Films based on novels\" describes films adapted from novels, the statement is correct."

Blackmore, and there are multiple film adaptations of the novel, only one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6441/re-ranker-msmarco/51.txt) specifically states that the 1912 British silent historical film directed by Wilfred Noy is \"a film adaptation of the 1869 novel Lorna Doone by R.
