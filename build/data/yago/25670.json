While it is noted that she married Prince Isarasundhorn as his second concubine and gave birth to Prince Tub (later Prince Jessadabodindra), it also states that in 1809, Prince Isarasundhorn was crowned King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, indicating a clear connection between Sri Sulalai and the king. Therefore, the statement \"Sri Sulalai is married to Buddha Loetla Nabhalai\" can be considered correct based on the provided context."
