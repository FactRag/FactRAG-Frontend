The text mentions that \"Princes et princesses, though released to cinemas a couple of years after Kirikou, is in fact a much older creation of Michel Ocelot\" and describes the film as being made by him. Additionally, other documents mention Michel Ocelot's previous work on films such as Kirikou and the Sorceress and Azur and Asmar, which suggests that he has experience creating animated films. Therefore, based on this information, it is highly likely that Michel Ocelot created Princes et Princesses."
