However, it does not explicitly state that Marco Ferreri \"created\" Bye Bye Monkey, but rather that he directed it. The text uses phrases like \"directed by Marco Ferreri\" to describe his role in the film's production. Therefore, while Ferreri was involved in the creation of the film as its director, there is no clear indication that he also \"created\" the movie in a more general sense."
