Specifically, document `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_21104/re-ranker-msmarco/6.txt` mentions that \"In 1245 Rudolph married Gertrude, daughter of Count Burkhard III of Hohenberg.\" Additionally, document `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_21104/re-ranker-msmarco/37.txt` and `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_21104/re-ranker-msmarco/6.txt` both mention Gertrude of Hohenburg as the first Queen consort of Rudolph I. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that Rudolph I of Germany is indeed married to Gertrude of Hohenburg."
