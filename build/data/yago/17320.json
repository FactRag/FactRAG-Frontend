However, one of the documents mentions that \"Kataoka, also known for his Subway Serial Rape series, used him (presumably referring to a character) in a cluster of films between 1985 and 1987, of which this particular title is the penultimate.\" This implies that Shuji Kataoka was involved with S&M Hunter as a director or creator, but it's not explicitly stated that he created it. The correct answer would be \"yes\" if one of the documents explicitly mentioned that Shuji Kataoka created S&M Hunter, which is not the case here."
