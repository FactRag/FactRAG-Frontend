Specifically:\n\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30866/re-ranker-msmarco/104.txt, it is mentioned that Jessica Buchanan (Natalie's sister) is the wife of Antonio Vega, and it also mentions Cristian Vega as Jessica's adoptive brother. However, this does not directly confirm the marriage between Cristian and Natalie.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30866/re-ranker-msmarco/23.txt, it is mentioned that Natalie Buchanan was born to Clint and Viki Buchanan, but it also mentions her significant romantic relationships, including Cristian Vega.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30866/re-ranker-msmarco/81.txt, it is mentioned that the fan fiction archive \"Possession\" is dedicated to the friendship and romance of Cristian Vega and Natalie Buchanan Vega. This implies a close relationship between the two characters.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30866/re-ranker-msmarco/22.txt, it is mentioned that Cristian Vega was married to Natalie Buchanan from 2003-2005.\n\nThese points collectively suggest a romantic relationship between Cristian and Natalie, with the specific marriage being confirmed in multiple documents."
