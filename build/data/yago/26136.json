This implies that Prince George Valdemar of Denmark is indeed married to Princess Anne of Denmark.\n\nAdditionally, another document mentions \"Princess Anne died in London in 1980, aged 62, of a myocardial infarction\", which further supports the fact that she was married to Prince George Valdemar of Denmark. \n\nSo, based on the information provided, the answer is affirmative."

Therefore, the triple \"Prince George Valdemar of Denmark is married to Princess Anne of Denmark\" is supported by the provided context."
