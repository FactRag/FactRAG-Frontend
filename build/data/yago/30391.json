In fact, one of the documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30391/re-ranker-msmarco/22.txt) mentions that Natalie had already married an older man named Michael Lazarus (who was actually Mitch Laurence in disguise), and then later reconciled with Cristian. This suggests that they may have had a romantic relationship, but the documents do not explicitly state that they are married.\n\nNote: The documents also mention John McBain as a romantic interest of Natalie Buchanan's, which further complicates the marital status between Cristian Vega and Natalie Buchanan."

Luckily, Cristian learned the truth about Jen\u2019s baby (it was actually Al Holden\u2019s) and the two reconciled.\" And \"Cristian and Natalie went on to be married, and Natalie found herself a new career: billiards. When detective John McBain came to town on a secret investigation, he used Natalie to get information on a man running a casino, Walker Laurence. Things ended badly when Natalie was kidnapped! Cristian saved Natalie, but was presumed dead.\" This indicates that Natalie Buchanan is indeed married to Cristian Vega."
