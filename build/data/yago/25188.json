However, this does not necessarily mean that Empress Dowager Longyu is not married to Emperor Guangxu, but rather that their relationship may have been complicated or strained. The documents do confirm that Empress Dowager Longyu was married to Emperor Guangxu at some point, and I should have answered \"yes\"."
