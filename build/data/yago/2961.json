This implies that Chakri (Rama I) was married to Amarindra.\n* However, there is no explicit statement in the documents that directly confirms Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke's marital status or relationship with Amarindra.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that the triple \"Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke is married to Amarindra\" is partially supported by the context information. While it is confirmed that Chakri (Rama I) was married to Amarindra, there is no explicit statement about Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke's marital status.\n\nTherefore, my response would be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
