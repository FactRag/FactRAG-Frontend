One document mentions a different band called \"Carnival of Killers\" and another document mentions a different person named Sheldon Reynolds who was a vocalist and guitarist with The Commodores and Earth, Wind, and Fire. However, there is no connection made between this Sheldon Reynolds and the creation of \"Killer's Carnival\", which seems to be related to a film or movie."
