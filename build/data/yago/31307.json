Although she later marries someone else and starts a romantic relationship with another person (Bianca Montgomery), her previous marriage to JR Chandler is mentioned as a past event. Therefore, the statement \"Marissa Tasker is married to JR Chandler\" is supported by the documents, even though it refers to a past situation rather than a current one."
