In fact, one of the documents mentions that Gus's marriage was dissolved in 2008 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_25893/re-ranker-msmarco/39.txt), and another document suggests that they were planning to get married but ultimately did not due to Olivia's interference (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_25893/re-ranker-msmarco/41.txt)."

For example, in `41.txt`, it states, \"One night, he arranged for a family dinner at the Spaulding house and wanted Harley to come. Though she agreed, he was shocked when Daisy and her father, Dylan, showed up to take Harley to dinner. Suddenly the two demanded that they have dinner with their respective children; neither would budge and Harley ended up leaving while Gus stayed at the mansion. It was becoming more apparent to Natalia that Gus's marriage was on shaky ground.\" Additionally, `39.txt` mentions \"Augustus 'Gus' Aitoro (dissolved) [2008]\" under marital status but also states that they got married again later. These details support the triple that Gus Aitoro is married to Natalia Rivera Aitoro."
