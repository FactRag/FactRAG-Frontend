However, one document does mention Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, and Louis Johnson in relation to the song \"Billie Jean\", which seems to be related to the character Billie Jackson mentioned in another context."

Additionally, there is information about events related to Billie Jackson's life, such as his funeral in 2010. This confirms that Tony McHale created this character for a storyline, likely within the context of a soap opera or television series mentioned in the documents."
