Specifically, document 21.txt mentions that Bertrade married Philip I of France on May 15, 1092 (as well as her first marriage to Fulk IV, Count of Anjou). This confirms that she was indeed married to Philip I of France.\n\nAdditionally, other documents, such as 8.txt and 51.txt, mention Philip I of France as Bertrade's husband, further supporting the correctness of this triple."
