In fact, one of the documents mentions that Neela is still mourning her husband.\n* However, another document mentions that Tony Gates has a daughter named Sarah with his wife Meg, and that he hopes to fight for custody of her.\n\nBased on this information, I would say that the statement \"Neela Rasgotra is married to Tony Gates\" is not supported by the documents. In fact, it seems that Neela is not even in a committed relationship with Tony Gates at the time of the story.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
