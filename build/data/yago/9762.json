However, they do imply that he directed or wrote the movie.\n* The fourth document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_9762/re-ranker-msmarco/67.txt) mentions Alan Rudolph and his film \"Love at Large\", but it does not provide any information about who created the movie.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I can conclude that the statement \"Alan Rudolph created Love at Large\" is supported by the documents. However, since the answer should be in JSON format, here's the response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
