For example, document `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_28928/re-ranker-msmarco/15.txt` mentions that they were \"known as the Duke and Duchess of Clarence\" and that William succeeded his brother King George IV as King on 26 June 1830, making Adelaide Queen Consort. Another document, `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_28928/re-ranker-msmarco/77.txt`, mentions that \"William IV of the United Kingdom & Adelaide of Saxe Meiningen were married on ...1818 in ....\" which confirms their marriage.
