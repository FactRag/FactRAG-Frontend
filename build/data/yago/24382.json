Putnam. However, one document mentions that George P. Putnam proposed to Amelia Earhart and eventually they got married, suggesting a romantic relationship between the two. However, there is no direct confirmation that they were married.\n\nThe documents also mention that Putnam was previously married to Dorothy Binney, which implies that he was not single when he started dating Amelia Earhart. This suggests that Amelia Earhart might have been his second wife, but it's not explicitly stated in the documents.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to confirm with certainty whether George P. Putnam was married to Amelia Earhart."
