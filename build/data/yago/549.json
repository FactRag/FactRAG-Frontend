The file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_549/re-ranker-msmarco/61.txt explicitly states that Julia was the daughter of Octavian and his wife Scribonia, and she married her cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus, then Augustus' friend and general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. The file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_549/re-ranker-msmarco/18.txt mentions that Julia was the wife of Tiberius, but it does not explicitly state that this is her first marriage to Tiberius or that she was previously married to someone else. However, based on the information in file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_549/re-ranker-msmarco/61.txt and other files, it can be inferred that Julia had previous marriages, specifically with Marcus Claudius Marcellus (in 25 BC) and then with Agrippa. Therefore, the specific triple \"Tiberius is married to Julia the Elder\" is not explicitly supported by the provided context information."
