For example, in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30168/re-ranker-msmarco/13.txt and file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30168/re-ranker-msmarco/95.txt, it is mentioned that Michelle Obama worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met Barack Obama, and later married him in 1992. Additionally, file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_30168/re-ranker-msmarco/82.txt mentions their wedding date (October 3, 1992) and how they got married at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. Therefore, the triple \"Michelle Obama is married to Barack Obama\" is supported by the provided context information."
