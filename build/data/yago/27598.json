However, they also report that he is divorcing her due to her desire to end their marriage. This implies that at the time of the divorce announcement (which appears to be in 2007 or 2008), Salman Rushdie and Padma Lakshmi were not married anymore.\n\nNote: The specific dates mentioned in the documents are:\n\n* File 91.txt: \"They married in a Hindu ceremony in New York in 2004.\"\n* File 75.txt: \"Confirming speculation that his wife, a former model turned TV presenter, wanted to end their three-year marriage, Sir Salman's agent claimed that the break-up had come at her instigation.\" (This suggests the marriage ended around 2007)\n\nThese dates suggest that the marriage between Salman Rushdie and Padma Lakshmi was over by 2007, making it incorrect to say that he is currently married to her."
