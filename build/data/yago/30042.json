This information supports the triple statement that Saif Ali Khan is married to Amrita Singh."

There is no information indicating that Saif Ali Khan is currently married to Amrita Singh; in fact, it is mentioned that they separated in 2004. Therefore, the statement \"Saif Ali Khan is married to Amrita Singh\" is incorrect according to the given context."

Although it's mentioned that Saif Ali Khan was married to Amrita Singh before, and they had two children together (Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan), it also states that \"they parted ways in 2004\" or \"the couple parted ways in 2004\"."
