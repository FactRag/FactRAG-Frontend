It does not fit the typical description of an \"art film,\" which usually refers to films that prioritize artistic expression over commercial appeal or mainstream entertainment, often involving experimental techniques or complex narratives. Paisan, while certainly a significant work with its innovative use of multiple perspectives and realistic portrayal, aligns more closely with the neorealist movement's goals of social realism and direct engagement with real-life situations.",
