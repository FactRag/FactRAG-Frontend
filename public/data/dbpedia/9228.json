The name \"George W. Bush\" appears multiple times across different documents, but none of them provide explicit confirmation that this is the only correct label for him.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the documents do consistently refer to the subject as \"George W. Bush\", without any apparent confusion or alternative labels being proposed. Nevertheless, based on the evaluation criteria, I cannot confirm the triple with absolute certainty, hence the output is \"no\"."
