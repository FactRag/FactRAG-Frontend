The protocols and technologies related to CubeSats, such as Cubesat Space Protocol (CSP) and various antenna designs, are also discussed in detail. This suggests that the subject of Cubesat Space Protocol is indeed related to CubeSats, making the statement \"Category:CubeSats\" a correct categorization for this topic."
