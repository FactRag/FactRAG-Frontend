On its official website, Sooriyan FM lists itself as the first private Tamil language radio station in the country.\"\n\nThis information shows that Sooriyan FM is a first-private Tamil language radio station but does not confirm whether Vettri FM was indeed previously known by this name.\n\nSince there's no direct information about when Vettri FM started broadcasting or confirming it being previously called so, I'll conclude that the given context doesn't provide enough details to support or deny the triple.\n\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n{'output': 'no'}"
