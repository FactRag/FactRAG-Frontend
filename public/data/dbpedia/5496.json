However, this is not the primary focus of the documents. The documents mainly discuss Olivier's life, career, and legacy, rather than emphasizing his cause of death as a central theme. Therefore, while it is true that he died from renal failure, the information does not strongly support the triple \"Laurence Olivier is about deaths from renal failure\" as its primary focus."
