The mention of \"Norfolk Ridge\" might be referring to a different aspect or concept related to the location, rather than being an explicit statement about its label. \n\nMoreover, in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5371/re-ranker-msmarco/77.txt, it is mentioned that \"You do wonder if Noel Coward had ever visited the county when he wrote in his play Private Lives: \u2018Very flat, Norfolk\u2019.  Anyone who has walked or cycled on the Cromer Ridge will know otherwise!\", which suggests that \"Norfolk\" might be a different label for the same location.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that the information does not strongly support the triple \"The label of Norfolk Ridge is Norfolk Ridge\". Therefore:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
