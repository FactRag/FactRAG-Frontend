However, one document also mentions that he was \"born and raised in New York City\", implying a specific connection to this city rather than just the country. Another document simply states \"New York\" without specifying \"City\". Therefore, while it can be inferred that Charles Strouse was indeed born in the United States, the available information does not provide explicit support for this statement with absolute certainty."
