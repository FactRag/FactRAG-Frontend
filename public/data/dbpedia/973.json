However, this does not provide any information about the direction St. James Church faces.\n* Another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_973/re-ranker-msmarco/101.txt) mentions that a church called \"St. James\" was founded on Main Street in Setauket, but this does not provide any information about the direction St. James Church in Monkton, Maryland faces.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I conclude that:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
