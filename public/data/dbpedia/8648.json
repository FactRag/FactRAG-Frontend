Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch). The documents only mention that they wrote it in partnership with each other, as an adaptation of the unproduced play Everybody Comes to Rick's."

Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that \"The subject of Casablanca (film) is Category:Screenplays by Julius J.
