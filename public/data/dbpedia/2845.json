This individual is referred to as John Nicholas Brown or simply \"Brown\" in some sections.\n\nThe relevant information is found in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2845/re-ranker-msmarco/83.txt, where it mentions that:\n\n\"On October 10, 1979, while celebrating his son John Carter Brown III's 45th birthday, John Nicholas Brown had a heart attack while on his yacht in Annapolis, Maryland and died.\"\n\nLater, it is mentioned that \"Brown was laid to rest, beside several of his ancestors, at the Brown family plot in the North Burial Ground in Providence.\" \n\nSince the documents mention multiple individuals named Nicholas Brown, and only one of them (John Nicholas Brown) has a specific resting place mentioned, I would say that the answer is:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}\n\nNote: However, this inference might not be entirely accurate if there are other Nicholas Browns with different resting places mentioned in the same documents or other related sources."
