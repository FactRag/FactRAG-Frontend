Documents 30, 36, and 42 also mention his death but do not specify the location, however, document 7 provides a clear statement about his place of death."

The details state his death occurred on Sunday at Cornell Medical Center in New York, and after his condition worsened, which implies the primary location of his passing was likely in a hospital setting rather than explicitly stating he died in New York city itself."
