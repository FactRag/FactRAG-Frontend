Blackmore\u2019s 1869 historical romance Lorna Doone made between 1911 and 2000.\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6442/re-ranker-msmarco/33.txt\n\t+ It is the kind of epic adventure tale that seems made for the screen\u2014the big screen certainly, but the small screen as well. Yet oddly enough, although I have not seen all of these adaptations, of the ones I have seen, none of them seem to have really done justice to the material\u2019s possibilities.\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6442/re-ranker-msmarco/80.txt\n\t+ Originally published in 1869, R.D. Blackmore\u2019s historical romance, Lorna Doone, remains a critically acclaimed story with several television and movie adaptations.\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6442/re-ranker-msmarco/80.txt\n\t+ Set in the 17th century during a fraught political climate, the novel centers on the star-crossed lovers, Lorna Doone and John Ridd, as they struggle to be together despite the differences in their social classes and the enmity between their families.\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6442/re-ranker-msmarco/9.txt\n\t+ Lorna Doone is based on the oft-filmed novel by Richard D. Blackmore. Set in 17th century Scotland during the reign of Britain's Charles II, the story concerns young Lorna (Barbara Hale), a member of a much-hated landowning family.\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6442/re-ranker-msmarco/97.txt\n\t+ Passionate love story set in 17th century rural England, charting the young John Ridd's search for revenge after his father's murder, and the chance encounter with beautiful Lorna Doone that changes the course of his life.\n\nBased on these statements, I can conclude that:\n\n{\n    \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
