However, it does not provide the runtime of this specific movie. Instead, it describes the movie as a \"lifeless bargain bin Woody Allen want to be\" and mentions that its plot is stale.\n\nHowever, there is another document with file path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2531/re-ranker-msmarco/31.txt which lists several movies, including \"This Boy's in Love\". But it does not mention the runtime of this movie. The runtime mentioned for a different movie called \"Beowulf\" is 1 hour and 49 minutes 27 seconds.\n\nAnother document mentions that a movie called \"This Boy's in Love\" has a padded 90 minutes, but it does not confirm if this is indeed the same movie or its actual runtime.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the information provided does not support the triple. The value should be:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
