Specifically, it mentions that the length of an object or figure is the longest dimension and shows how long the given object or figure is (see file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_992/re-ranker-msmarco/25.txt).\n\nIn another part of the documents, we find a specific example about an arc on a circle with a length of 50 feet. Although this is not directly related to the book \"By the Way\", it shows that the concept of length and its measurement are discussed in the context.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it appears that the statement \"The length of By the Way is 295.0\" is indeed supported by the documents, and hence, the answer is \"yes\"."
