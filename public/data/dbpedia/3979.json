Boggs passed away at Signature Healthcare at Parkwood in Lebanon, Indiana. However, another context suggests that Richard L. Boggs died at UCLA Medical Center in Westwood, California. Given the query only states \"Richard Boggs\" without specifying which one, and considering the provided documents, it is reasonable to infer that there could be a Richard Boggs who died in California based on the information given. Therefore, the response aligns with the information available."
