Brown, an actor who starred in this film and was popular during that time period (1930s) in Hollywood, indicating his connection to U.S.-produced films.\n\nGiven these details, the statement about the country of production for \"Broadminded\" being the United States is correct according to the documents provided. \n\nTherefore, the response should be:\n\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}"
