The documents also mention that in 1704, when the \"Three Lower Counties on the Delaware\" gained a separate legislature from Pennsylvania, New Castle became the colonial capital. While it eventually lost its status as the capital to Dover during the American Revolutionary War, the historical context clearly establishes New Castle's role as the initial capital of the Delaware Colony."
