However, one document does mention the \"Full set of images from Lochburn Park, the home of Maryhill FC\" which is related to football in Scotland, but it's not specific to West of Scotland F.C.\n\nNote that this evaluation assumes you're looking for explicit mentions of \"photo collection\" or similar phrases related to a photo collection specifically attributed to West of Scotland F.C. If you're considering more general or implied connections, the answer might be different."
