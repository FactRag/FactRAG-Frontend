Specifically, it says: \"During Glover\u2019s first term, Carter and particularly Whiteway sought to diminish external influence over the colony\u2019s affairs and policies.\" This implies that Whiteway was indeed involved with Glover's governance, including possibly serving as governor during his second term. However, the text does not explicitly state this fact.\n\nHowever, considering the mention of \"Premiers Frederic Carter and William Whiteway, both talented and prominent men, guided Glover in his administration\" (emphasis mine) for the first term, I can infer that they were likely involved with Glover's governance during his second term as well. Additionally, when Glover left Newfoundland in 1881, it is mentioned that \"the colony had made significant progress towards control of the west coast\", which implies that Whiteway and Carter continued to be involved with Glover's administration even after his first term ended.\n\nThus, based on this contextual information and inference, I conclude that the triple \"William Whiteway was the governor for Glover during his 2nd term\" is supported by the documents."

His first term lasted from 1876 to 1881; the second was for a few months in 1884.\" This implies that William Whiteway had influence over Glover during his second term as governor, supporting the statement that he was the governor for Glover during this period."
