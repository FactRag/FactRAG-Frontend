The documents suggest that Friedrich von Rabenau himself was born with this name, and there are no indications that he was known by any other full name. However, in some contexts, it's possible that he might be referred to without the \"Friedrich\" part, simply as \"Rabenau\". Nevertheless, given the provided context, it seems reasonable to say that \"The name of Friedrich von Rabenau is Rabenau, Friedrich von.\" is not strictly incorrect. However, based on the strict interpretation of the query and considering what is actually stated in the documents, a more accurate assessment would be that there's no definitive evidence in the provided texts that this statement is false or incorrect, hence it should be evaluated as \"yes\", but I have marked it as 'no' since we're looking for strict correctness.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in knowing whether his full name matches exactly what he was known by during his lifetime and according to the documents, then yes it does.\n\nIf there's any ambiguity or additional context that could suggest otherwise, please let me know."
