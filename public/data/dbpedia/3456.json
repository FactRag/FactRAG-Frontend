On both the Circle line and the green line, Blackfriars was located between Temple and Mansion House.\"\nThis document indicates that there might be some ambiguity or conjecture about the name \"Blackfriars\", but it clearly states that the original station was on the Circle line.\n\nDocument 5:\n\"...it provides Thameslink services: local (from North to South London), and regional (Bedford and Cambridge to Brighton) and limited Southeastern commuter services... It also has a connection to the London Underground District and Circle lines.\"\nThis document describes Blackfriars as having connections to both the Circle line and another line, but it doesn't provide enough information to confirm that it's exclusively a Category: Circle line station.\n\nDocument 6:\n\"...Blackfriars Underground station, District line (now District & Circle lines).\"\nThis document clearly states that Blackfriars is on the District line (and previously District & Circle lines), not the Circle line.\n\nGiven the information from all documents, it appears that Blackfriars has connections to both the Circle and District lines, but it's not exclusively a Category: Circle line station.
