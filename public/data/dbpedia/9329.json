They mention that Zemun was a separate town from Belgrade until the mid-1930s, when it was absorbed into the capital city. However, they also state that Zemun is one of the 17 municipalities which constitute the City of Belgrade, the country's capital (Serbia). This suggests that Zemun is indeed part of Belgrade, making \"The capital of Serbian Vojvodina is Zemun\" a correct statement based on the provided documents."
