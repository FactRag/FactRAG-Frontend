AKA Silly Grampa,Tom or Tommy\" which implies that Thomas Mansfield is also known by different names.\n* Document file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5285/re-ranker-msmarco/100.txt mentions \"Thomas W. Mansfield\" without any additional aliases.\n\nThe information in the documents supports the triple that Thomas Mansfield is also known as other names, but it's not explicitly stated that he is specifically \"also known as\" Thomas Mansfield. However, considering the structure of the provided queries and answers, I assume you're looking for a simple yes/no answer based on the presence of any additional aliases.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\nNote that this might not be the most accurate or detailed response to your query.
