The document mentions \"V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University\" multiple times and highlights its role in organizing conferences dedicated to Borys Hrinchenko. Additionally, it is mentioned that Borys Hrinchenko\u2019s pedagogical career began at Karazin University, which indicates his significant ties with the university where he likely received his education or conducted substantial work. Given these connections, it can be reasonably inferred that Borys Hrinchenko attended or was closely associated with the University of Kharkiv/Karazin University."
