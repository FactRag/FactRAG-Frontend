However, this description does not necessarily mean that the leader of Uttarakhand is Unicameral. The document mentions Pushkar Singh Dhami as the current Chief Minister of Uttarakhand (documents 12 and 71), but it does not mention anything about the name of the unicameral system being used in Uttarakhand. Therefore, the information in the documents does not support the triple \"The leader name of Uttarakhand is Unicameral\"."
