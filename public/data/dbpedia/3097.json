This document also does not specify the location of his death.\n\nHowever, Document 2 mentions that Bhanubhakta Acharya died at the age of 54, which implies a birth year consistent with other documents (i.e., 1814).\n\nThere is no mention of Tanahun District as the place where he died. \n\nTherefore, based on the available information:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
