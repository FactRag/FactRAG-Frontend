However, given the context of the Stratovarius documents, I assume the triple might be related to Timo Tolkki's departure from the band.\n\nThe documents suggest that Timo Tolkki left Stratovarius in 2008 and formed a new band called Revolution Renaissance. The remaining members continued under the name Stratovarius with Matias Kupiainen as the new guitarist. This information contradicts the idea that \"Timo Tolkki is still a part of Stratovarius\" or similar, making it likely that the triple in question is indeed about Timo Tolkki's departure from the band.\n\nHowever, without an explicit triple statement, I can only provide a response based on my understanding. If you could provide the actual triple to be evaluated, I would be happy to give a more accurate answer."
