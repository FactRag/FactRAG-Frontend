There is no information about his profession being journalism.\n* The fourth document mentions Bj\u00f8rn Andreas Bull-Hansen, which seems to be a different person from the one mentioned in the previous documents (Bj\u00f8rn Hansen). However, this document does not provide any information that would support or contradict the statement about Bj\u00f8rn Hansen being a journalist.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, I conclude that there is no evidence to support the statement \"Bj\u00f8rn Hansen (journalist) was born in Norway.\""
