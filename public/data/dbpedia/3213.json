This information appears in files 149.txt, 88.txt, and 164.txt.  \n\n\n\nTherefore, the triple \"Crytek UK is located in the United Kingdom\" is supported by the given context."

However, this does not imply that Crytek UK itself left the United Kingdom.\n* The fifth document quotes Karl Hilton, Managing Director of Crytek UK, explaining why they joined TIGA (a trade association) and mentions their office spaces in Nottingham.\n\nOverall, while there is some mention of movement within the company, the information does not support the claim that Crytek UK is no longer located in the United Kingdom."
