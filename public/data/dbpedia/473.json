Instead, it says \"Place of birth: Honolulu\" but in the context of mentioning his campaign information, which implies that Honolulu might be his current or recent residence rather than his birthplace. The only mention of a specific place of birth for Les Ihara, Jr. is in another document where it simply states \"He passed away peacefully at Castle Medical Center on February 3, 2023 surrounded by family.  Les was a Hilo High and University of Hawaii graduate.\" but does not specify his birthplace."
