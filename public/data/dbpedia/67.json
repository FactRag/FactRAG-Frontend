The first document mentions \"This accessibility statement covers https://www.darlingtonhippodrome.co.uk/.  This website is run by Darlington Borough Council.\" which indicates that Darlington Borough Council is indeed responsible for the mentioned website.\n2. However, it does not explicitly mention the label of the council.\n3. The second and third documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_67/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt and file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_67/re-ranker-msmarco/93.txt) contain information about Darlington Borough Council, but they do not mention the label of the council.\n4. The fourth document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_67/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt) mentions that \"This website is run by Darlington Borough Council.\" and also contains information about other councils, but again, it does not mention the label of Darlington Borough Council.\n5. The fifth document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_67/re-ranker-msmarco/93.txt) contains a statement \"Darlington Borough Council\" without any quotes or context indicating it's the label.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot confirm if the information in the documents supports the triple as there is no explicit mention of the label of Darlington Borough Council being 'Darlington Borough Council'. However, it can be inferred from other sources (not provided here) that 'Darlington Borough Council' is indeed a label for the council.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
