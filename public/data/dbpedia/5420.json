However, it also specifies that Azuara is not mentioned as one of these countries.\n- Document 3 explains that Central European Summer Time (CEST) corresponds to UTC+02:00 and is used as a summer daylight saving time in most European countries. It doesn't specify any location other than the general information about Europe.\n\nBased on this analysis, I couldn't find any specific information linking Azuara with Central European Summer Time (CEST).
