In June 2007, he and Chvojka lost in the first round of the UniCredit Czech Open, which was Pospisil's first ATP Challenger event.\n\nIn November 2008, he won the Challenger Banque Nationale de Rimouski doubles title with compatriot Milos Raonic and two more ITF Futures doubles titles.\n\nIn May 2009, Pospisil and partner Adil Shamasdin won the Mexico F4 and F5 doubles titles, as the tournament top seeds. In July 2009 at the USA F17 in Peoria, Illinois, Pospisil reached his first professional singles final, losing to Michael Venus.\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1275/re-ranker-msmarco/22.txt\n\nFull Round 2 results can be found here: http://eur.pe/17vapHk.

Due to this very aggressive style of play she makes a lot of unforced errors during matches.\n\nPrivate life\n\nIn the past, Kvitova was in relationship with Czech tennis players Adam Pavlasek and later with Radek Stepanek. She then started dating Czech hockey player Radek Meidl in June 2014. In December 2015, it was officially announced in Czech media that the couple were engaged. The news was later confirmed by both Meidl and Kvitova.\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1275/re-ranker-msmarco/12.txt\n\n20 Ivo Karlovi\u0107 and world No. 18 Grigor Dimitrov.\n\n2017: Mixed results\n\nDuring the offseason, Pospisil hired Hall of Famer Mark Woodforde to be his new coach. At his first tournament, the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, he reached the doubles final with Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek. In February, he won his two singles matches at the Davis Cup World Group over top 50 players Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans. The next week at the ATP Challenger 100K in San Francisco, Pospisil made it to the singles final where he was defeated by Zhang Ze in three sets. At the Masters 1000 BNP Paribas Open in March, Pospisil qualified for the main draw and defeated Lu Yen-hsun in the opening round.\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1275/re-ranker-msmarco/6.txt\n\nToday I realized I\u2019ll have something to put on it.
