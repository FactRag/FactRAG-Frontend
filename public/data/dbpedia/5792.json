The document associated with file_path \"/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5792/re-ranker-msmarco/49.txt\" mentions that Noam Chomsky's father, a professor of Hebrew, was influenced by anarchist literature and platforms. Later in the same document, it is mentioned that Ren\u00e9 Descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers, but there is no direct influence relationship mentioned between the two individuals. However, the document associated with file_path \"/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5792/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt\" mentions that Descartes suggested a strict division between the mind (a non-material entity) and the body (a physical entity), which can be related to Chomsky's views on human nature, as mentioned in another document. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is reasonable to conclude that Noam Chomsky was influenced by Ren\u00e9 Descartes' ideas on the mind-body dualism."

Additionally, there is a reference to Chomsky as being involved in \"Cartesian Linguistics,\" directly linking him to Descartes' work."
