When \u201cA Lesson Before Dying\u201d assumes that the audience is smart enough to follow along without having to be beaten about the head and shoulders, it soars.  Conversely, it sags when it explains too much.\n\n Nonetheless, \u201cA Lesson Before Dying\u201d will doubtless be a strong Emmy contender this year.  And it should\n\n... \n\nAnd from the document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6051/re-ranker-msmarco/13.txt, we have:\n\nA Lesson Before Dying is a 1999 American television drama film directed by Joseph Sargent which aired on May 22, 1999 on the HBO network.\n\nThis clearly indicates that HBO is indeed the company behind 'A Lesson Before Dying (film)'. Therefore, the answer is \"yes\"."
