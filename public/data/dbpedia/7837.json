The documents mention that Fula is a major language spoken by more than 65 million people across several African countries, including regions such as Guinea, Senegal, Nigeria, and Sudan. Given this information, it can be reasonably inferred that Fula is one of the languages spoken in Niger, supporting the given statement."

However, the information does not specifically state that Fula is one of the primary or official languages spoken throughout all of Niger, though it acknowledges its significant presence.\n\nGiven this nuanced situation and since the query asks if \"The languages spoken in Niger are Fula language,\" which could be interpreted as being exclusive (i.e., only Fula), without explicit confirmation of such exclusivity or dominance from the document, we must conclude that there's insufficient support to confirm the statement fully.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis indicates that while Fula is indeed spoken in Niger and mentioned as one of the languages covered by ProofreadingServices.com's translation services, the documents do not provide enough information to confirm it as being the sole or primary language spoken throughout the country."
