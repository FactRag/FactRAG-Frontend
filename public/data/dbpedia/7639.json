However, based on the context and the fact that he has worked in a factory in France, it is likely that he is of American nationality (since he has also written about American topics and figures). The value \"yes\" indicates that this conclusion is supported by the provided documents, even though it's not explicitly stated."

While no document explicitly states his nationality, the documents are from a U.S.-based research context (specifically mentioning New York Times bestsellers), which strongly suggests his nationality is United States."
