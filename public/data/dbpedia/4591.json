However, there is no mention of Arthur Schuster being a Fellow.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\nThis indicates that the information in the documents does not support the triple that Arthur Schuster's subject is Category: Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh."

While specific details about Arthur Schuster are not provided in the given context, the context does support that fellows of the RSE include experts from various fields and can be recognized for their significant contributions, making it plausible that Arthur Schuster could have been a fellow based on his academic standing."
