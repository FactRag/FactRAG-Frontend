The document only mentions that the screenplay concerns two London rubbish collectors who come into possession of a valuable book, which is not equivalent to saying the entire subject of the film is set in London."

The document does not mention that the film's subject is set in London; rather, it confirms that the setting is indeed London. However, the year mentioned (1936) contradicts the query\u2019s statement that the film was from 1956. Therefore, the answer is \"no\" as there are discrepancies with both the time frame and the plot summary provided in the documents."
