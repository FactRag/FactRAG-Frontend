However, it can be inferred from the context that the novel is likely to be written in English, as it is an Agatha Christie novel and the quotes provided are in English. But there's no explicit mention of the language.\n\nHowever, since we're evaluating whether the information supports the triple \"The Alphabet Murders is written in English\" without prior knowledge, and given that the documents don't explicitly state this, the answer should be 'no' as it cannot be confirmed from the provided context."
