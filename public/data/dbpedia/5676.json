This suggests that NewSong might be associated with Integrity Music, but not necessarily a specific record label named \"Integrity Records\".\n* Another document mentions \"NewSong Recordings\", which is an in-house record label founded by NewSong, indicating that they have their own record label.\n* There is no mention of a Christian-specific record label called \"Integrity Records\" associated with NewSong."
