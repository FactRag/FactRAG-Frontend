Some of these mentions include:\n\n* A musician who is described as an electronic music artist from the United States.\n* A writer who was born on April 7, 1924, in Bakersfield, California, USA.\n* An actor who was born on July 8, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, USA.\n* A person named Robert (Bob) L White who was born on October 30, 1925, in Marceline, MO.\n\nNone of these mentions explicitly state that the person is a guitarist. The document with the file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_504/re-ranker-msmarco/13.txt contains information about an electronic musician named Robert White, but it does not mention his birthplace as the United States (it mentions that he \"hails from\" the United States).\n\n**Conclusion:** The information in the documents does not support the triple.\n\n**Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
