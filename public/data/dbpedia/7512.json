However, it is mentioned that Wu-chung received his Ph.D. under the guidance of Norman Steenrod, and Edwin H. Spanier received his doctorate from the University of Michigan under the direction of Norman Steenrod. But there is no indication that Wu-Chung was a doctoral student of Norman Steenrod, but rather the other way around."

Instead, it is mentioned that Wu-chung received his Ph.D. under the guidance of Norman Steenrod, which implies that Norman Steenrod was Wu-Chung Hsiang's doctoral advisor."
