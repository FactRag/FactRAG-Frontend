The context also includes information about the history of Ronneby, its attractions, and the fact that it has non-stop flights available from Stockholm. Based on this information, it can be inferred that Ronneby Municipality refers to a type of administrative division or entity, which is not necessarily a list of sovereign states. Therefore, the statement is correct according to the documents."
