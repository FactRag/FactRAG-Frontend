Smith and his relation to a particular category or title (Category:DePauw Tigers football coaches). Based on this assumption, here is my evaluation:\n\nThe documents mention Edwin O. Smith as a coach at various levels, including Calhoun County High School, VMI, Duke, and Appalachian State, but they do not specifically mention DePauw Tigers football coaches.\n\nTherefore, the response would be:\n{'output': 'no'}"
