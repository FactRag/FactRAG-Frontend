The provided context mentions that Radio France changed its logo and branding to better reflect its current direction.   The text states: \"After a complete renovation, Radio France, the leading French radio Group, wished to shift its brand identity and part with its former logo created in 2005.\" This directly supports the statement that the label of Radio France is 'Radio France'."
