However, some of the documents do mention his personal life and achievements, which might be related to Category:Deaths or other categories.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I found a document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5835/re-ranker-msmarco/95.txt) that mentions \"Ike's personal life should not overshadow his achievements in music\". This statement implies that Ike Turner's personal life, including his death, is a subject of interest.\n\nBut then I found another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5835/re-ranker-msmarco/101.txt) that clearly states \"Ike Turner, whose role as one of rock\u2019s critical architects was overshadowed by his ogre-like image as the man who brutally abused former wife and icon Tina Turner, died today (Dec. 12) at his home in suburban San Diego.\" This document explicitly mentions Ike Turner's death date.\n\nConsidering these documents together, I believe that the triple \"Ike Turner's subject of interest is Category:2007 deaths\" is partially correct, but not entirely accurate. The subject of interest seems to be more related to Ike Turner's life and achievements, rather than just Category:2007 deaths.\n\nHowever, given the provided context information, it might be reasonable to assume that Category:2007 deaths could be a related category for Ike Turner's subject of interest.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}"
