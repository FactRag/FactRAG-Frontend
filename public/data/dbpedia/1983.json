In fact, he is described as the Chief Advocate for National Seniors Australia, which suggests that his primary role is not journalism, but advocacy."

They mention his work in various television and radio programs, his awards (such as Telstra Rural Journalist of the Year), and his current role as Chief Advocate for National Seniors Australia where he discusses financial issues affecting older Australians. These details strongly support categorizing him as a category: Australian journalists."
