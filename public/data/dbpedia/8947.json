They also consistently mention Gotha as one of the main towns within the duchy, with some descriptions specifically stating that Frederick's residence remained at the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha (or Schloss Friedenstein in another description). This suggests a strong connection between Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and the town of Gotha. \n\nTherefore, based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the capital of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was indeed Gotha."

Specifically, one document mentions \"Frederick's residence remained at Schloss Friedenstein in Gotha,\" suggesting that Gotha was an important location within Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, which is consistent with the capital being Gotha. Therefore, the statement \"The capital of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg is Gotha\" is supported by the documents."
