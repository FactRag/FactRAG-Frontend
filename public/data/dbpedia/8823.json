It also states that it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1982.\n* **Interpreting \"Category: Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia\":** This category refers to houses that are officially listed as historically significant by the National Register of Historic Places and are located within Virginia.\n\nSince Upper Shirley is confirmed to be a historic plantation house added to the National Register of Historic Places, the triple aligns with the information presented in the text. \n\n\n"

However, there is no direct confirmation that it is specifically a house on the National Register of Historic Place in Virginia.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would say:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

Specifically, it mentions that \"Upper Shirley is a historic plantation house\" and provides details such as its construction dates (1868-1870) and its inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places with reference number 82001884. This aligns with the statement that Upper Shirley is categorized as a house on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia, thus the answer is \"yes\"."
