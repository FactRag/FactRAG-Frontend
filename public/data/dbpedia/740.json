The politician is described in documents 28 and 115 is not relevant but document 108 talks about a boxer.\n* There is no information that explicitly states that Jack Dempsey (the politician) is alive or dead.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would conclude that the statement \"Jack Dempsey (politician) is about Living people\" cannot be definitively confirmed or denied based on the provided context.

The information given only mentions his current position as an ORTWS Legislative Liaison and past roles such as campaign and Capitol staffer, Director of Health Policy and Government Relations, and Associate Director of Government and Community Relations. There is no explicit statement confirming whether Jack Dempsey is currently alive or not. However, based on the context, it seems he might be a living person given his recent positions, but this cannot be conclusively determined from the provided information alone. Therefore, we answer with \"no\" as there's insufficient evidence to support that Jack Dempsey (as described in these documents) is definitively about living people."
