In fact, one of the documents mentions that the territorial capital was moved to Tucson in 1867, then returned to Prescott in 1877, before being finally moved to Phoenix in 1889. This suggests that while Prescott did serve as a capital of the Arizona Territory at various points in time, it was not consistently or exclusively the capital throughout its history. Therefore, the triple \"The capital of Arizona Territory is Prescott, Arizona\" is not supported by the information in the documents."
