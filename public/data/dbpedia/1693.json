While there isn't a direct statement confirming Katherine Vaz has a Wikipedia article, all the documents consistently focus on her reading, writing style, and even mention details about her book \"Below the Salt\". This high frequency of mentions strongly suggests she is the primary subject of a Wikipedia article. \n"

The documents also mention that she studied letters of soldiers from the Library of Congress to acquire knowledge for her novel. This suggests that Katherine Vaz is indeed the primary topic of a Wikipedia article with the same name.\n\nNote: I'm assuming that the fact that there are multiple documents mentioning Katherine Vaz does not affect this evaluation, as it's likely that these documents are discussing the same person."

This information supports that Katherine Vaz is the primary topic of discussion in these documents, thus aligning with the query stating she is the subject of a Wikipedia article about her."
