This implies that \"Visionary Dream\" was recorded before Diana Gurtskaya's entry, making the triple correct according to the documents."

With the song Visionary Dream, she reached the final and finished 12th. The following year, Diana Gurtskaya came 11th - and Georgia had established themselves as a country to watch out for.\" This suggests that Diana Gurtskaya performed \"Visionary Dream\" in a previous Eurovision Song Contest, thus supporting the statement."
