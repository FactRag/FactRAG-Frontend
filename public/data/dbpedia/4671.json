In document 21.txt, it mentions that \"Giessmann drummed for The Del Fuegos, and Goffrier formed the band Big Dipper with former members of the Volcano Suns.\" This establishes a connection between the two bands. Additionally, in document 55.txt, it is mentioned that Bill Goffrier was the leader of Kansas punks The Embarrassment, which further solidifies their association.\n\nIn document 39.txt, it also mentions that \"The lyrics tell the colorful true story of said Mr. Klaus, bassist for art-punk indie band The Embarrassment (whose guitarist went on to help co-found Big Dipper; yes, it's a convoluted web of musicians!)\". This implies a close relationship between the bands and their members.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the triple \"The Embarrassment is associated with Big Dipper\" is supported."
