In fact, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) is mentioned as a different party, and it's stated that the Speaker of Dewan Rakyat received a letter from Bersatu vice-president about four alleged vacant parliamentary seats in Sabah. This suggests that Dewan Rakyat and Parti Bersatu Sabah are separate entities."
