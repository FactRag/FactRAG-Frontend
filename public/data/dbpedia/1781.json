Specifically, they mention Lord George Sackville as being second in command during the raid on St Malo in June 1758 and imply his significant role in these operations. While he was not explicitly stated to be the commander, given his high-ranking position (Lieutenant General) and active involvement, it is reasonable to infer that he played a commanding role in this operation."
