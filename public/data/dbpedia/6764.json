If interpreted as whether the only label for Rudyard Kipling should be his name, then based on the documents which describe him using various labels such as 'imperialist', 'racist', and 'jingoist' (though they caution these are superficial), it would be incorrect to say that \"Rudyard Kipling\" is the only label for him. However, his full name is indeed correct and accurate as a label for identifying Rudyard Kipling himself. Thus, if the query intends to verify whether \"Rudyard Kipling\" (his name) correctly identifies him, then it would be correct, but since the query does not specify this and seems overly simplistic or misworded, I've provided 'no' as an answer based on the context that additional labels have been applied."
