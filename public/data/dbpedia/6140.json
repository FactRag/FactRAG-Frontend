However, it does not state that M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro was influenced by Oscar Wilde. In fact, the text implies the opposite: \"it was S\u00e1-Carneiro who first read him closely\" (meaning Oscar Wilde), suggesting that S\u00e1-Carneiro influenced Pessoa's reading of Wilde rather than being influenced by Wilde himself."
