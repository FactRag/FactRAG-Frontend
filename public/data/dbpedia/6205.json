The text mentions that the park was established in 1958 under Ontario regulation 251/58, but it does not provide information on ownership."

For instance, document 100.txt states, \"Aaron Provincial Park is a must-visit this summer,\" and another excerpt indicates its location relative to Ontario's administrative districts, suggesting oversight by Ontario Parks. Therefore, based on the provided context, the statement aligns with the documents."
