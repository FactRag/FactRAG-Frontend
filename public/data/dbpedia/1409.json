However, one of the documents mentions a match between Tasmania and New South Wales, where Jackson Bird took 7 wickets for 18 runs off his 10 overs.\n\nGiven this information, I can conclude that Tasmania did take some wickets in an innings, but there is no explicit mention of taking 1/12 (one twelfth) wickets. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that the triple statement \"Tasmania took 1/12 wickets in an innings\" is likely incorrect based on the provided context information."

Specifically, in `122.txt`, it states \"Smith\u2019s fifth wicket came in the final over of the innings, capping it off with another caught-and-bowled to remove Sarah Coyte.\" This indicates that a wicket was taken, and given the context, it is reasonable to infer that this refers to 1/12 wickets as part of an innings."
