In fact, it is mentioned in another document (`/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9133/re-ranker-msmarco/32.txt`) that Gitega carries a rich historical significance that goes back many centuries, and that it was initially the seat of the Burundian monarchy. However, there is no specific mention of Gitega being the capital of the Kingdom of Burundi.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Kingdom of Burundi existed until the late 19th century, and it's likely that its capital would have been different from the current capital of Burundi."
