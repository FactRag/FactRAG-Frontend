The value of the answer could be:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\nHowever, to make it more nuanced, we could consider adding additional context or notes to clarify the relationship between Marc Allen and New World Library's founding.\n\nIf I were to rephrase the question to better capture the nuance, I might ask:\n\n\"Marc Allen is one of the co-founders of New World Library.\"\n\nIn that case, the answer would be:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\nBut if we stick with the original question, the answer could still be:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"

Therefore, the statement \"Marc Allen is the founder of New World Library\" is supported by the information given, albeit with a slight correction to specify he is one of the founders rather than solely the founder. However, based on the context provided, it can be reasonably inferred that Marc Allen played a key role in establishing the company, and thus the answer aligns with \"yes.\""
