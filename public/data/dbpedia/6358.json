While it is mentioned that the film was released in Italy and directed by Roberto Rossellini, who is also Italian, this does not necessarily mean that the language of the film is Italian. The documents do mention that the subtitles are Turkish, which suggests that the original dialogue may be in a different language (Italian or another language spoken during World War II). Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be definitively stated that \"Paisan\" is an Italian-language film."
