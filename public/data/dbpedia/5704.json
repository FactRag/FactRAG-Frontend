The text actually describes it as a modern-day thriller and mentions Liam Neeson's status as an elder statesman of B-movie tough guys, implying that it might be a British or international production rather than American. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text, so we cannot confirm whether \"Non-Stop\" is indeed an American film or not."
