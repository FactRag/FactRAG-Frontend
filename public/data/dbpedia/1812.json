Use the code provided under free map link above the map.\nEnrich your website or blog with hiqh quality map graphics.\n```\n\nThis suggests that a map of Boalkhali is available and can be embedded on a website, but it does not provide any information about a specific website for Boalkhali Upazila.\n\nHowever, I also found this line:\n```\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1812/re-ranker-msmarco/62.txt\n```\n\nWhich suggests that there is another document related to the same topic (Boalkhali Upazila), but it does not provide any direct information about a website.\n\nGiven this context, I would say that the triple is \"no\" because there is no direct evidence in the documents that supports the specific website http://www.banglapedia.org/Maps/BoalkhaliUpazila.jpg as the website of Boalkhali Upazila.\n\nSo, here's my response:\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
