The documents also mention various sightings and mentions of the phrase in different contexts, such as in a London Underground lift, on a World War II Memorial, and even having been engraved behind gates at the National Mall (DC). This information collectively supports the idea that \"Kilroy was here\" is indeed a subject within the category of English phrases."
