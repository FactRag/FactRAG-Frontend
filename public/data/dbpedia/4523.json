However, this does not explicitly state that the Gambino Family was involved.\n* In the second file_path (/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4523/re-ranker-msmarco/47.txt), there is a mention of Snoop's family and his half-siblings, but no connection to the Gambino Family.\n* The third file_path (/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4523/re-ranker-msmarco/132.txt) discusses a different topic altogether (19 Crimes wine brand) and does not mention Snoop or the Gambino Family.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that:\n\n{'output': 'no'}\n\nThe information in the documents does not support the statement \"The Gambino Family group is associated with Snoop Dogg\"."
