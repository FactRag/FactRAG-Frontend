However, it does not specifically mention A.C. Milan.\n* Document 2 reports on Fatih Terim testing positive for COVID-19 while being the manager of Galatasaray, but it also mentions his previous stint as a manager at A.C. Milan in 2001, where he managed the team for about 5 months with an attacking philosophy.\n* Documents 3 and 4 provide additional information on Fatih Terim's career, including his stints as a manager at Galatasaray, Milan, and Fiorentina. Document 3 mentions that he was involved in a fight and subsequently parted ways with the Turkish Football Federation due to non-football related issues.\n* Document 5 provides further details on Fatih Terim's management style and his experiences at Milan and Galatasaray.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
