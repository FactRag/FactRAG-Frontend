However, since at least one document mentions that James Clyde Stroud was born on September 9, 1952, in Paoli, Indiana, United States, and considering \"Paoli\" is a town in Indiana, which is within the United States, we can infer that there is support for this statement. Given no contradictory information and the presence of relevant details, the response aligns with the assumption that James Stroud was born in the United States."
