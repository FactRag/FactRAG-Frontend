The document from file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1153/re-ranker-msmarco/12.txt mentions the death of Viktor Fedorovich Bolkhovitinov on January 1, 1970 (which is incorrect), but another document mentions that he died on January 29, 1970. The city of death is not specified in any of the documents."

While the exact location of his death is not explicitly stated, given his residency in Moscow and the time period mentioned, it can be reasonably inferred that he likely died there. Therefore, the statement \"Viktor Bolkhovitinov died in Moscow\" is supported by the context information provided."

Therefore, given the lack of direct evidence to support or refute the statement that he died in Moscow, we cannot confirm this information from the provided context.\n\nHowever, since the question is framed as an evaluation and asks for a \"yes\" or \"no\" response based on the documents, and there's no explicit mention supporting his death location being Moscow:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis answer indicates that while Viktor Bolkhovitinov may indeed have died in Moscow (as suggested by some biographical references), the given context does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim definitively."
