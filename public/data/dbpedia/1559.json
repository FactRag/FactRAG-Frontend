However, since the document does not contradict this statement either and it mentions \"Denis Perger\" as the name of the subject in various contexts (e.g., football player profile), we can infer that the triple is likely correct based on the available information."

Since the triple states that \"The full name of Denis Perger is Denis Perger,\" which matches the information given in the documents, the answer is \"yes.\""
