However, they do not indicate that ALGOL was an influence on ALGOL 58. In fact, the opposite is true: ALGOL 58 introduced concepts such as structured programming constructs and formal parameters in subroutines that later influenced the development of ALGOL 60, among other languages. Therefore, the statement \"ALGOL 58 was influenced by ALGOL\" is incorrect according to the documents."
