However, based on the context information provided, it appears that \"You Have to Run Fast\" is actually an article or a list of running movies, but it does not specify whether they are all American films. While some examples mentioned (e.g., Forrest Gump) are American films, others (e.g., Cars and Ford v Ferrari) have international connections. Therefore, the information in the documents does not provide conclusive evidence to support the claim that \"You Have to Run Fast\" is exclusively about American films."
