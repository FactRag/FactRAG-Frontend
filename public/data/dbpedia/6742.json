However, later on in the same document, it is mentioned that \"The 221st Combat Communications Squadron is co-located in Grand Prairie with their command unit, the 254th Combat Communications Group.\" This does indeed mention Grand Prairie, which is located in Texas.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the answer to your question would be:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}"
