The first document calls it a \"kingdom\", while the second document refers to it as a \"nation in Europe\". Although the third document only mentions it as a \"sovereign state\", there is no indication that it still exists or holds the title of \"Kingdom\" today. Similarly, the fourth and fifth documents mention its history and existence as a separate nation prior to being absorbed into Spain, which supports the conclusion that it was indeed a former kingdom."
