Instead, they appear to be job postings or promotional materials for various roles within the company, such as a Strategic Business Development Manager or a Sales Career journey with uncapped commissions."

While the exact phrase \"careers guidance service\" is not used, the context of offering quizzes, scorecards, and advice for career growth aligns with the idea that Ignition provides some form of career support, advice, and guidance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the statement about Ignition being a careers guidance service is supported by the documents."
