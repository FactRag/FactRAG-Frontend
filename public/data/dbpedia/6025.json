In document 12, it is mentioned that \"The Settlers\u00c2\u00ae : Rise of an Empire - History Edition\" was developed by \"Ubisoft Blue Byte\".\n\nHowever, since this specific game variant (\"History Edition\") is not the focus of the original triple statement (\"Rise of an Empire\"), we need to look for information about the original \"Rise of an Empire\". In document 35 and 28, it is mentioned that \"The Settlers: Rise of an Empire\" was developed by Blue Byte Software (not explicitly mentioning Ubisoft as a part of the developer name), but published by Ubisoft. This information indirectly supports the triple statement, as the original game variant's development company is indeed referred to as Blue Byte in some documents.\n\nTherefore, based on the available context information and considering the indirect support from document 35 and 28, I conclude that the triple statement is likely correct according to the provided documents."
