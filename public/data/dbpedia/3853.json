It does mention that there were reported 27,704 battle deaths among U.S. Army personnel in Korea.\n\nDocument 2 (28.txt) discusses a study on North Korean conventional military power, using the \"Attrition-FEBA Expansion Model\". The model estimates that the actual North Korean military strength is probably smaller than what is usually believed. However, it doesn't provide an estimate of the total strength for the war.\n\nDocument 3 (114.txt) provides more information about the military forces involved in the Korean War, including numbers of soldiers, tanks, artillery pieces, and aircraft for both North and South Korea. It mentions that the ROK had 98,000 soldiers as of June 25, 1950, but it doesn't provide a total strength for the war.\n\nDocument 4 (28.txt) estimates that there would be 1,700 US casualties, resulting in 400 KIA, if North Korea were to invade South Korea. However, this is not related to the total strength of the Korean War.\n\nGiven this information, I can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThe documents do not provide sufficient evidence to support the triple that the strength of the Korean War was 26,000."
