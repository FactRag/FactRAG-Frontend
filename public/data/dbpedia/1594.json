It confirms that Requeij\u00e3o is indeed described as a milk-derived product made in both Portugal and Brazil.\n2. It mentions that it is sometimes referred to as reques\u00f3n (the Spanish word for ricotta) in English-speaking countries.\n3. One of the descriptions states that Requeij\u00e3o can be similar to loose, ricotta-like cheese used to make cheese spreads or substituted with a mild unsalty ricotta.\n\nHowever, there's no mention of it being sold wrapped in fresh corn husks within the provided texts.\n\nThe statement is correct based on the documents but includes an aspect (being wrapped in fresh corn husks) that cannot be verified from the given context. Given this analysis, the answer must consider whether including unverified information invalidates the overall correctness of the statement. Since most parts are accurate and only one aspect is unsupported:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis response reflects that while many details are correct, the inclusion of an unsubstantiated claim makes the entire statement not entirely supported by the documents provided."
