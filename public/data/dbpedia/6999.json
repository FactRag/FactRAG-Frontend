Education is described as an end in itself, with people seeking knowledge even if all problems of economic and social life were solved (document 71). This implies that education has an intrinsic value and is not merely a means to achieve something else."

This can be seen from sentences like \"Education is not \u2018about\u2019 anything except education.\" and \"It is an end in itself.\" Therefore, the response to whether \"Education was not done by anything\" aligns with the information provided in the documents."
