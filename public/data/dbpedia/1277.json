However, since there is no explicit mention of the tournament or the year, I will assume that the query is about the Concord Ia\u0219i Open.\n\nThe relevant information from the documents suggests that:\n\n* The document mentions Cezar Cre\u021bu playing with Dmitry Popko in the 2012 Concord Ia\u0219i Open.\n* There is no mention of Cezar Cre\u021bu playing with any other partner, such as Bogdan Pavel or Gabi Boitan, in the 2012 Concord Ia\u0219i Open.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it appears that the answer to the query is:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}\n\nPlease note that this answer assumes a specific interpretation of the triple and may not be accurate if the actual triple is different."
