The agreement specifically mentions that it is a SHRINKWRAP LICENSE AGREEMENT, which implies that it is proprietary software. Additionally, another document mentions that BeOS is an operating system with a proprietary license. Therefore, the information in the documents supports the triple that the license of BeOS is Proprietary software."
