This implies that WKPA had a sister station, which could be an AM or FM station. The specific name of the sister station is not mentioned as WKBA (AM), but rather it's implied to be a different station (WYDD-FM). However, this does not necessarily contradict the statement \"WKPA has sister station WKBA (AM)\". In fact, the text only provides evidence that WKPA had at least one sister station, and the name of the sister station is not explicitly stated as WKBA. Therefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be concluded with certainty whether WKPA indeed has a sister station named WKBA (AM), but the statement \"WKPA has sister station\" is supported by the text.\n\nNote that this answer assumes that the query is asking if there's any evidence in the documents that suggests WKPA has a sister station, regardless of its name. If the query specifically asks about the existence of a sister station with the exact name \"WKBA (AM)\", then the correct answer would be \"no\", as the text does not explicitly mention this name."
