This strongly suggests a connection between Sultan Mudzafar Shah I and the category of monarchs from Kedah. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other triples you'd like me to evaluate!"

The document also mentions that the tomb discovered by PSMCK belongs to him, which supports the category \"Monarchs of Kedah\"."
