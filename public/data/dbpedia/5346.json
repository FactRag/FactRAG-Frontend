However, in document 1.txt (which has the same file_path as 51.txt), it mentions that Chelsea Clinton's husband is Marc Mezvinsky, but again, there is no information about his father.\n\nIn document 51.txt, though, on July 31st, 2010, Chelsea Clinton married Marc Mezvinsky, and then later in the text, it mentions that Marc Mezvinsky's father, Edward Mezvinsky, was a former congressman who pled guilty to fraud charges. This confirms the information in the triple.\n\nSo, based on this context, the answer is \"yes\"."
