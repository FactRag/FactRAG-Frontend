In fact, the document mentions that Assahra Al Maghribiya is a daily arabophone Moroccan newspaper of Maroc Soir Group, which was acquired by Saudi Arabian media executive Othman Al Omeir, while Le Matin du Sahara et du Maghreb is described as a \"daily francophone Saudi-owned Moroccan newspaper\". This suggests that they are actually separate newspapers with different ownership structures."
