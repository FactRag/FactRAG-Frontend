For example, from document 1: \"The metro system spans a huge area in Bangalore\", and from document 7: \"Namma Metro, also called the Bengaluru Metro, is a rapid transit system that runs in the capital of Karnataka (which includes Bangalore)\". Therefore, the information in the documents supports the triple."
