There are descriptions of different types of Requeij\u00e3o, such as \"requeij\u00e3o from Vale da Estrela\" and \"Requeij\u00e3o cheese\", but no information is given about the aging process or its relation to specific varieties."

For example, one document discusses the aging process of Queijo de S\u00e3o Jorge and another mentions that Emmental is distinctive due to its large holes running through it after being aged. Although directly stated for requeij\u00e3o in the provided texts is not present, the context implies that cheese varieties do age differently depending on their type, which supports the statement that requeij\u00e3o ages depending on its variety."
