The documents seem to be discussing a film, a hiking trail, and other topics unrelated to writing or languages. Therefore, we cannot determine if the triple is correct based on the provided information."

All of the text provided is in English and discusses an American silent drama film produced in 1917. Given that there's no mention of any other language version or country of production besides America for this film, it is reasonable to conclude that \"On the Great White Trail\" was written in English."
