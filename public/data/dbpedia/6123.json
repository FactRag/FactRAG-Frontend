    "object": "Blackadder: Back & Forth is a 1999 sci-fi comedy film based on the BBC mock-historical sit-com Blackadder that marks the end of the Blackadder saga. It was commissioned especially for showing in the specially built \"SkyScape\" cinema, erected southeast of the Millennium Dome on the Greenwich peninsula in South London. The film follows Lord Edmund Blackadder and his idiotic servant, Baldrick, on a time travel adventure that brings the characters into contact with several figures significant to British history.In a 1999 interview, Richard Curtis described it as \"an irreverent trek through British history \u2013 a time travel adventure story consisting entirely of people who are either rude or stupid.\" Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson reprised their roles as the series' core characters Blackadder and Baldrick, respectively. In an interview, Atkinson stated that making a Blackadder film had always been an ambition. Joining Atkinson and Robinson are other main cast members from the last three series, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerny and Miranda Richardson.",

The documents provide details about the context, cast, and plot of the film \"Blackadder: Back & Forth\", but they do not mention that it is a 1999 sci-fi comedy film based on the BBC mock-historical sit-com Blackadder that marks the end of the Blackadder saga. \n\nHowever, the text does state that the film is set on New Year's Eve 1999 and involves time travel, which might suggest some connection to science fiction elements. Nevertheless, the primary focus of the film appears to be a comedy with historical connections rather than a traditional sci-fi narrative.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it seems that the statement is not entirely supported by the available context."
