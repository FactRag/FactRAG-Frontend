Later, some units were sold to SCT, while others remained with Pacific National. The current status is not explicitly mentioned for AWB Limited being the owner, but it is mentioned that five V/Line fleet units would pass into SSR ownership in 2019, and three units are retained by V/Line. Therefore, there is no indication that AWB Limited owns the V/Line G Class."

The relevant information states that some G Class units passed to CFCLA, SSR, Qube Logistics, OneRail, and Pacific National. There is no direct mention of AWB Limited as the current owner."
