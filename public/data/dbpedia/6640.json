Reeve being born in 1928, none of them specify September 18 as the birthdate. Some documents mention different birthdates (e.g., \"in 1928\", \"September 18, 1928\", and \"born on September 18, 1928\") or lack a specific date altogether, so there is no conclusive evidence to support the triple \"F.D.
