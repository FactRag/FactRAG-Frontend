Where local indigenous groups perceived the landscape as a productive environment, Chaco denoted an infierno verde or \u2018green hell\u2019 to the newly arrived Mennonites and the encroaching armies.\"\n\nTherefore, it's possible that 'In the Hell of Chaco' is not the only possible label for this work. However, given the context information provided, I couldn't find any document explicitly stating that the label for 'In the Hell of Chaco' is something other than 'Chaco'.\n\nBased on this analysis, my response would be:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
