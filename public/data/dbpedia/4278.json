However, these documents do not provide information about his birthplace.\n* Another document mentions a Hermann Schubert born on July 10, 1964, in Munich, but this does not mention the Kingdom of Prussia as his birthplace.\n* A document mentions a Heinz Hermann Schubert born on August 27, 1914, in Berlin, which is also within Germany, but again, not specifically mentioning the Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nHowever, there are two documents that provide information about a person named Friedrich Herman Schubert or Hermann Schubert born in Richford, Waushara Co., WI (1879) and another document mentions a Hermann Schubert from 1921-1995 with no clear connection to the Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that there are multiple individuals named Hermann/Hermann/Schubert mentioned across different documents, but none of them specifically mention being born in the Kingdom of Prussia.

During the time of Hermann's birth (1892), Hannover was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, as Prussia controlled Hanover from 1714 to 1918.
