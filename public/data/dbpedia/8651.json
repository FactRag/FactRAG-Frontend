However, it can be inferred from the information provided that the National Medal of Arts is an award presented by the President of the United States for artistic excellence, and it has a specific design by sculptor Robert Graham, but the actual label \"National Medal of Arts\" is only used as a direct quote in one of the documents. Therefore, based on the available information, the correct label might be more accurately described as \"the nation's highest honor for artistic excellence\" or another equivalent phrase."
