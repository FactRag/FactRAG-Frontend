However, none of these discussions categorize this topic as \"Category:States and territories established in 1796\".\n\nWhile some information about military lands is provided, it focuses on the size of land controlled by the Defense Department globally, not specifically on the establishment year or category of United States Military Lands. The context does mention various dates and events (e.g., Puerto Rico's invasion in 1898), but none are directly related to the categorization of \"United States Military Lands\" as a state or territory established in 1796.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that this triple is incorrect (\"no\")."
