Given that the query pertains to a fictional band (implied by 'The New Cars') and their likely American origin as suggested by multiple references to North American cities in the document related to Disney/Pixar's Cars movies, it can be reasonably inferred that this information supports the statement \"The New Cars' hometown is United States.\" However, if there were specific documents or sections directly addressing \"The New Cars,\" they are not included here.
