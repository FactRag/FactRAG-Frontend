The documents mention that Protestantism began making inroads into the Philippines during the American colonial period (1898-1946) when missionaries from the Lutheran, Methodist, and other churches began fanning out through the islands to win converts. This matches the time frame mentioned in the triple. Additionally, the documents state that American missionaries played a pivotal role in promoting Protestantism in the Philippines, which supports the claim that American missionaries were mostly responsible for introducing Protestantism. However, it is worth noting that some Protestant churches in the Philippines were founded locally, as also stated in the triple."

Additionally, the documents note that while some Protestant practices integrated into Catholicism and were introduced by missionaries from various churches like Lutheran, Methodist, and others, there is also mention of the establishment of independent Protestant churches in the Philippines."
