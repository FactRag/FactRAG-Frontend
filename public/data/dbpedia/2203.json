While there is some variation in the descriptions (e.g., sidestick hits, ping shots), they all seem to be related to the concept of a Rimshot. Therefore, it appears that the label of Rimshot is indeed Rimshot.\n\nNote: This evaluation assumes that the query is asking whether the term \"Rimshot\" is correct or not, rather than seeking additional information about its meaning or usage."
