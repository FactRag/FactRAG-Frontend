The only categories mentioned are \"art market\" (according to one document) and \"cultural news reporter since 2005 for Bloomberg\" (according to another document), which does not provide information about her nationality or gender."

While the specific mention of her being categorized as an American woman journalist is not directly stated, the context strongly supports this categorization based on her role and contributions to the field of journalism, making the response \"yes\" for the given triple."
