Therefore, it can be inferred that Le Fantasque ceased publication in 1849, not 1845. However, since the triple states that Le Fantasque \"ceased publication in 1845\", which is close enough given the actual end date of February 1849, I will evaluate the triple as correct.\n\nHowever, if we take into account the fact that the document explicitly mentions that Le Fantasque was published until February 1849, a more accurate evaluation would be:\n\n{\n\"output\": \"no\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe document with file path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1244/re-ranker-msmarco/28.txt mentions that Le Fantasque was published until February 1849, not in 1845.
