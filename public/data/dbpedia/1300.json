However, upon closer inspection, it appears that most of these documents refer to individuals who were born before 1954, except for Mary Margaret Neal, age 59. The triple statement \"Mary Neal's given name is Mary\" can be considered supported by the document where a person named \"Clara Sophia Neal\" (who later had her first name changed to Mary) is mentioned, but this does not directly confirm that the given name of the Mary Neal who died in Manchester-by-the-Sea is indeed \"Mary\". However, there are multiple documents mentioning individuals with the last name \"Neal\" and a given name starting or similar to \"Mary\", which might be considered as supporting evidence for the triple statement. But it seems more accurate to consider this answer as 'no' because we cannot directly confirm that the Mary Neal who died in Manchester-by-the-Sea is indeed named \"Mary\"."
