However, this does not directly confirm or deny his hometown as being in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the response should reflect that there isn't sufficient information to support the claim:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis answer indicates that while Gregory Rogove likely has some connection with the United States due to his work and collaborations, it is not clear from the documents whether he was born or grew up in the U.S. as his hometown."
