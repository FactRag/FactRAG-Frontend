Instead, they describe it as an American, Swiss, and West German international co-production drama film (document 62), a US-German co-production (document 42), and a story about four American soldiers being tried for the rape of a German girl in Occupied Germany (documents 106 and 42). Therefore, while Town Without Pity does contain elements that could be classified as German drama films, its subject is more accurately described as a US-German co-production or an international drama film."
