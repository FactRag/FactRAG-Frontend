The context information mentions him commenting on a case from 2009 and discussing the high cost of involvement in the war against the Taliban, but it does not explicitly state that he is an expert on this specific topic."

The information provided supports that Ken Gillespie's expertise includes Australian military personnel involved in conflicts, particularly those related to the War in Afghanistan (2001-present)."
