Allen's birth and death dates, as well as his associations with Delaware (e.g., being a U.S. House Representative for the state, having a scrapbook collection donated to the University of Delaware).\n* Specifically, document #4.txt mentions Alfred William Allen Sr.'s association with Lewes, Delaware, but it does not provide information about William F. Allen.\n* Document #83.txt explicitly states that William Franklin Allen was born in Bridgeville, Delaware, and died in 1946.\n* Documents #13.txt and #37.txt mention William F. Allen's associations with Delaware, including his death location (in one of the documents), but neither provides specific information about a connection to Lewes.\n\nOverall, while there are multiple mentions of individuals named William F. or Franklin Allen across different documents, they do not seem to be the same person based on the provided context and dates mentioned in the scrapbook entries. However, it can be concluded that at least one of the mentions refers to an individual with strong ties to Delaware, which aligns with the query statement.\n\nBased on this analysis, I've marked the output as \"yes\"."
