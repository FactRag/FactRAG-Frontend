For example, `49.txt` mentions \"Samuel Fitch was born on Nov 9 1626 in Bocking, Essex, England\" and later discusses his presence in Connecticut, indicating he moved to or settled in the Connecticut Colony. Additionally, `36.txt` states that there is a possibility Samuel Fitch I settled at Milford, CT., as early as 1644, further supporting his connection to the Connecticut Colony."
