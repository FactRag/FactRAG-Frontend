The categories listed for some of the files, such as `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5047/re-ranker-msmarco/57.txt`, include \"Categories: Human Interest, Science & Technology\", but not specifically \"Pilot-Cosmonauts of the USSR\". However, considering his occupation as a cosmonaut, it is reasonable to infer that he was also a Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR."
