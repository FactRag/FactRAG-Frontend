However, none of these films are mentioned as being shot in Paraguay. In fact, some of the documents suggest that filmmakers have had to overcome significant challenges to make films in Paraguay due to lack of resources and equipment.\n\nFor example, one document mentions that Juan Carlos Maneglia and Tana Schembori had to buy most of their equipment from Amazon because Paraguay didn't have adequate rental businesses. This suggests that filmmaking infrastructure is lacking in the country, but it doesn't necessarily mean that films are shot in Paraguay."
