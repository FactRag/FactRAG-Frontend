The first document mentions a Scottish actor named James Donald who was born in Aberdeen and died in Wiltshire. This individual is referred to as \"James Donald\" or \"James Robert MacGeorge Donald\", and his biography includes details about his acting career and personal life.\n\nThe second document, which also mentions a person named Harold Lewis, does not provide any information about the James Donald who matches the query's criteria. It only provides information about someone named James Giles, who lived from 1829 to 1877.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, it can be confirmed that the statement \"James Donald died in Wiltshire\" is supported by the information in the documents."
