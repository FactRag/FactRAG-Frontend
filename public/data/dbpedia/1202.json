In fact, it says that \"Hanna, who's also known from her bands Bikini Kill and The Julie Ruin, formed Le Tigre nearly 25 years ago...\" This suggests a close association between the two bands.\n\nAdditionally, the document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1202/re-ranker-msmarco/44.txt mentions that The Julie Ruin is \"featuring Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre\". This further reinforces the connection between the two bands.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it appears that Le Tigre is indeed associated with The Julie Ruin."
