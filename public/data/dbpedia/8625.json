However, one document states he grew up in Khandallah, Wellington, which could imply he was born there or nearby since it's common for people to grow up where they are born. Considering this indirect evidence and the lack of contradictory information stating his birthplace elsewhere:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```\n\nThis answer is based on the assumption that growing up in a place generally means one was born there, unless stated otherwise. If strict proof of birth specifically at Wellington is required, then further confirmation would be needed since it's not explicitly stated in the documents provided."
