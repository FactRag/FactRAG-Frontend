However, there is no mention of a currency used by the Taifa of Arjona being the Gold dinar.\n\nIn fact, one document mentions that Muhammad ibn Nasr, the founder of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada, was a sultan who ruled in the taifa of Arjona, but it does not provide any information about the currency used during his reign."

Given the time period (1238-1273) and location, it is reasonable to infer that the Gold Dinar was indeed a common currency used in the region, as it was widely circulated in Islamic Spain at that time. However, for absolute certainty, more direct historical evidence would be needed."
