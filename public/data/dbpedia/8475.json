They provide information about the film, its director (Alfred Hitchcock), and its novel adaptation from Daphne du Maurier, but they don't categorize it under \"British novels\" as a separate entity. However, since the query specifically asks if Jamaica Inn is an instance of \"Films based on British novels\", the answer should be negative because the provided documents do not confirm this categorization directly."
