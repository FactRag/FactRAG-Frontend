In one of these documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6391/re-ranker-msmarco/65.txt), it's mentioned that \"No Way Out\" is a 1973 horror thriller, also known as The House That Cried Murder. In another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6391/re-ranker-msmarco/31.txt), it's described that \"The Way Out\" has the look and feel of a modern Lifetime thriller, but then also categorizes No Way Out as a queer take on Fatal Attraction. However, in neither document is \"No Way Out\" explicitly categorized as a psychological thriller film.\n\nHowever, we can infer from other documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6391/re-ranker-msmarco/102.txt) that it is possible for a movie to be classified under the broader category of \"psychological thriller\" given the description of the genre as revolving around the mind in a thriller. Therefore, we can reason that No Way Out might be considered part of the psychological thriller film genre.\n\nNote: The answer assumes a context where categorizing movies into genres is possible with the information available in these documents."
