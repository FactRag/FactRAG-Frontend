In fact, document 75.txt mentions that Arthur Wilkinson was born on September 3, 1919, which would make him around 49 years old in 1968, if he had died then. However, none of the documents confirm his death year as 1968. Document 88.txt does mention a Clarence Arthur Wilkinson dying in 2002, and document 105.txt mentions a James Arthur Wilkinson dying in 2023, but there is no information about an Arthur Wilkinson dying in 1968."
