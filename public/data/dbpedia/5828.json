However, there is no explicit mention of the language being English. Nevertheless, considering the context (a book about a British protagonist and set in London), it can be inferred as English, but this might not be explicitly stated anywhere.\n\nHowever, more specifically, regarding the query \"The language of 'Asking for Trouble' is English.\", given that there's no direct confirmation of the language being English within the provided documents and only an implicit assumption based on the context (a book set in London), a more accurate response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"maybe\"\n}\n```\n\nBut if I had to choose between 'yes' or 'no', given that there is some indirect support for it, I'd go with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
