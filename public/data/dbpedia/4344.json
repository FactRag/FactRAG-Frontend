It is not explicitly mentioned what happened after the 1937 final, but it can be inferred from the context that if a championship has been held in previous years (including 1937), it would likely continue to be held in subsequent years. Therefore, the information supports the idea that the 1938 All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship Final was indeed followed by the 1939 championship final (or later), and by extension, also implies that a final was held in 1938."
