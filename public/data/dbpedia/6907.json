While the movie's premise involves gay characters, its primary focus appears to be on Axel's experiences and relationships rather than specifically on gay comic books or themes.\n\nSo, based on this evaluation, I conclude that the statement is not entirely accurate as it doesn't capture the film's primary theme."
