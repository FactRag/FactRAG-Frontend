Additionally, one of the documents directly states that \"Mephisto can be understood as the director\u2019s mea culpa and self-criticism about his actions in the shady and controversial communist era which haunted him ceaselessly.\" This further reinforces the connection between the film and the Faust legend. Therefore, the information supports the triple that Mephisto (1981 film) is about Category:Works based on the Faust legend."
