The document text explicitly states \"Our plush products are named after the word \"Skog\" which means \"Forest\" in Swedish.\" and further down, \"This is where the very first Skoggy Bears were found, deep in the Swedish woodlands\".\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can confidently say that the label for \"Skog\" is indeed \"Skog\". \n"

This document explicitly states that \"Skog refers to a large area covered chiefly with trees and undergrowth. In English, this translates to \u201cforest\u201d.\", which supports the triple statement that the label for Skog is 'Forest'."

In the document `36.txt`, there are references to \"Skog\" which means \"forest\" in Swedish, and it's used as a name or term multiple times. This supports that \"Skog\" is indeed labeled as 'Skog'."
