However, there is no information that suggests its capital is Spain. In fact, the text mentions Seville and Malaga as separate cities to which Taifa Of Algeciras can be visited as a side trip. This implies that Taifa Of Algeciras might have been a smaller administrative division within a larger region, rather than an independent country or city with its own capital. Therefore, it is unlikely that the capital of Taifa of Algeciras is Spain."
