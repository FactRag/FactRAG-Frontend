However, without more context, it's difficult to say whether this statement is true or false based solely on the given text.\n\nHowever, since you're asking me to provide an answer in JSON format with either 'yes' or 'no', I would have to say that there isn't enough information provided in the context about a thumbnail for Berestia being Vlag_ontbreekt.svg."
