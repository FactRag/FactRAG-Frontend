However, they do not mention that the film is based on German novels. While it is mentioned that the film is an adaptation of Klaus Mann's novel \"Mephisto\", which explores themes of ambition, corruption, and moral compromises made during times of political upheaval, there is no specific information about the film being based on German novels in general."
