However, based on the provided context information, we are looking for a triple statement related to Tapulous, but it's not specified.\n\nGiven that we have multiple documents related to Tapulous, I'll try to make an educated guess about what you might be asking. Here's my interpretation:\n\nTriple: The label for Tapulous is [some specific label].\n\nBased on the context information provided, I couldn't find a clear statement confirming a specific label as the only or primary label for Tapulous. However, I did find mentions of various labels partnering with Tapulous, such as EMI and UMG.\n\nSince there are multiple labels mentioned as partners with Tapulous, but not a singular \"the\" phrase that would suggest it's the only label, I'm going to assume the triple statement is likely incorrect.\n\nResponse: {'output': 'no'}"
