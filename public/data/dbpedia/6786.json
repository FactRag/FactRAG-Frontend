There is also a mention of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, Rome, Italy, as part of his description. Additionally, one of the documents mentions that he died on 21 April 1073, which implies that he died while still being the head of the Roman Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States, both of which are based in Rome. Therefore, the statement \"Pope Alexander II died in Rome\" is supported by the information in the documents."
