This also supports the triple.\n* Documents 44.txt, 53.txt, and another instance of 53.txt all confirm that Juba is the capital city of South Sudan.\n\nGiven that all documents provide consistent information supporting the statement \"The capital of South Sudan is Juba,\" I conclude:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
