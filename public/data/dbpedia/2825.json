This suggests that the question \"The Grattan Bridge is a type of Bridge\" is not particularly informative or surprising given the context. The answer would be \"yes\", but it's implied rather than explicitly stated.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, the answer could be argued to be \"no\" because the documents already specify what kind of bridge Grattan Bridge is (road bridge), making the question about its type a bit redundant. But in the spirit of providing a clear and concise evaluation, I've chosen to provide an answer of \"yes\"."
