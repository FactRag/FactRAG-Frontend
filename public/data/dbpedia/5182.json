This suggests that Dallas County is located to the southeast of Denton County, which implies that Denton County is located to the northwest of Dallas County.\n\nHowever, according to document /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5182/re-ranker-msmarco/8.txt and /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5182/re-ranker-msmarco/61.txt, Denton County is located in North Texas, just north of Fort Worth and northwest of Dallas. This information suggests that Denton County is actually located to the north-northwest of Dallas County.\n\nGiven this context, it seems likely that the correct relationship between Dallas County and Denton County is indeed \"to the north-northwest\" rather than \"to the northwest\". Therefore, I conclude that the triple is supported by the documents."
