In fact, three separate sources (files 5, 43, and 61) report her death in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, on March 1, 2017, at the age of 86, or in June 16th, aged 75 years, with no mention of a US location. The document about her life as an American film actress (file 0) does not contain information about her death, but it is consistent with the other sources that she was born and lived part of her life in the USA, which would suggest that she could have died there. However, this is not explicitly stated in any of the provided documents, so we can conclude that the statement \"Dorothy Appleby died in the USA\" cannot be definitively verified as true based on the available information."

The closest relevant document is 16.txt which provides her birth and death years, but there is no specific mention of where she died. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed based on the given context."
