However, it does not explicitly state that Adam Stansfield is the primary topic of a Wikipedia article by that name. Nevertheless, based on the context and the fact that there are multiple entries for people with the same last name, it can be inferred that an individual named Adam Stansfield could plausibly have a Wikipedia article dedicated to them.\n\nBut if we look at the second document, which mentions \"Adam Jensen\", it is likely that this is referring to the main character of a video game, and not Adam Stansfield. \n\nSo I would say that the answer is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
