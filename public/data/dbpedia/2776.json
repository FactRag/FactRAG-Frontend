However, it does not explicitly state that Valis II is running on MSX or not.\n* The third and fourth documents mention the Valis series and its various games, but do not provide information about Valis II's compatibility with MSX.\n\nGiven this analysis, I conclude that:\n\n{ \"output\": \"unknown\" }\n\nHowever, since you asked me to provide a simple \"yes\"/\"no\" answer, I will assume that \"unknown\" is equivalent to \"no\", and the correct response would be:\n\n{ \"output\": \"no\" }"
