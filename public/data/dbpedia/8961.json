It uses the Reichsmark as its currency.\" Similarly, in `/Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8961/re-ranker-msmarco/7.txt`, it mentions: \"Reichskommissariat Ostland is a German colony in Eastern Europe, comprising of Belorussian and former Baltic lands. The colony borders the Greater Germanic Reich and the General Governorate of the Vistula to the west, Reichskommissariat Ukraine to the south, Reichskommissariat Moskowien to the east, and the Baltic Sea to the north. The colony is considered a model for other Reichskommissariats. A large majority of the population has been Germanized to some regard, with much of the Native resistance being eliminated.\" While this does not directly state the currency, it contextualizes that Ostland was part of the Greater Germanic Reich where the Reichsmark was used."
