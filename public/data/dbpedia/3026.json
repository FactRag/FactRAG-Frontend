For example:\n    * \"Casema was a leading Dutch cable television provider based in The Hague, with 1.3 million subscribers.\" \n\n* **Triple Confirmation:** This directly supports the triple \"Casema is located in The Hague\"."

The total enterprise value of the transaction is \u20ac2.85 billion. Casema is the third largest cable operator in the Netherlands serving the central and western parts of the country, covering such cities as The Hague, Utrecht, Breda and areas surrounding Amsterdam.\")."
