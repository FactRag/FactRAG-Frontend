He was 73.\" This suggests that the statement might be true.\n\nHowever, another document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4757/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt has a conflicting information:\n\"He was 73.\"\n\nThis is not sufficient to confirm the death cause of Sydney Pollack.
