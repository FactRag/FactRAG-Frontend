In fact, one document refers to him as an \"American Activist\" and another mentions his role in the Yippies, but there is no direct statement confirming his label as \"Jerry Rubin\"."

They mention his involvement with the Yippies, being part of the Chicago 8, and also include details from his later life where he became a President and Chief Executive Officer of JVS. These roles confirm that \"Jerry Rubin's label is Jerry Rubin\" is correct in the context provided."
