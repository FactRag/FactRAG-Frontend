In some cases, it is mentioned that Sri Lanka ranks in range of 84th-92nd in term of population density around the world (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6782/re-ranker-msmarco/48.txt), while another source mentions a rank of 342 people per square kilometer in 2021 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6782/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt). Therefore, the population density rank is not consistently reported as 40 across all sources."
