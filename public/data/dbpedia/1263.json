However, they have different locations and establishment years.\n\n1. The first document mentions a Chandi Das Mahavidyalaya without specifying the location.\n2. Two subsequent documents mention Chandidas Mahavidyalaya located in West Bengal (one specifically mentioning Birbhum district), with one of them also mentioning an affiliation with NAAC-C, which implies it's a recognized institution.\n\nConsidering this information, it appears that there are indeed colleges or institutions named Chandidas Mahavidyalaya, and at least one of them is located in West Bengal."
