This supports the first part of the triple.\n- The documents also mention that candidates will have graduated with an excellent degree and must have completed at least two years of legal studies and have advanced experience in legal research, supporting the second part of the triple.\n- The third part of the triple is partially supported by the documents, which describe different roles judicial assistants may play in hearings across various Member States. However, it does not provide a clear answer to what role Judicial Assistants primarily play in hearings.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I evaluate the triple as \"yes\", with some nuance regarding the third part."

However, the query suggests that the documents discuss roles and duties within judicial settings which are consistent with the content about Judicial Assistants. Given the nature of the documents focusing on roles such as Judicial Assistants, it can be inferred that they are primarily about these roles in a court context. Thus, the answer aligns positively with the idea that the documents are centered around the work and duties of Judicial Assistants."
