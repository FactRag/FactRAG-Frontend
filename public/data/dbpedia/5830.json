However, it also mentions that throughout its existence, Ramot Menashe has received members from various countries including Argentina, Romania, Chile, Uruguay, and Israel. This suggests that while Polish immigrants might have been among the original founders, they were not the sole or primary group of founders, contradicting the claim that Ramot Menashe was founded by Polish immigrants exclusively.",
