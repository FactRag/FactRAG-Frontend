However, none of these mentions directly state that Masha-ye Pang Posht Kuh Do Sari is part of Anbarabad County.\n\nIn fact, one of the documents mentions a village called Anbarabad in North Khorasan province, which seems to be a different geographical location from where Anbarabad County (in Kerman province) is located.\n\nBased on this information, I would say that:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`\n\nThe context does not explicitly support the claim that Masha-ye Pang Posht Kuh Do Sari is part of Anbarabad County."

Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the statement might be correct without explicit proof to the contrary."
