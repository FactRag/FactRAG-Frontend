However, it does mention that infectious diseases can be transmitted through direct person-to-person contact, which occurs when a person with an infectious disease touches or exchanges body fluids with someone else in the same location. This information implies that Direct Contact is not a physical location but rather a means of transmission.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\nSo, according to the documents, the triple \"Direct Contact is located in the United States\" is incorrect."

Additionally, it mentions that everyone is at risk of illness due to direct or indirect contact with infectious organisms. While the documents do not directly state \"Direct Contact\" as a company or organization located in the United States, they provide information about environments where people are at risk from diseases, which can be interpreted to imply such locations and contacts are within the U.S., thus supporting the query."
