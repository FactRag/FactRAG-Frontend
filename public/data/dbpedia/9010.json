In document 17.txt, it is mentioned that \"The brainchild of cosmic lo-fi Florida-born indie folk artist, Chad R. Matheny, Emperor X began his aural assault in the late '90s...\". This suggests that Emperor X originated from Florida, which is part of the United States.\n\nIn document 10.txt, it is also mentioned that Chad Matheny, the person behind Emperor X, \"is currently meandering the states on a U.S. tour\", implying that he (and therefore Emperor X) is based in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the triple \"The hometown of Emperor X is United States\" is supported by the documents."
