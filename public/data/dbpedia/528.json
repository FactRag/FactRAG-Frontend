The document mentions Lewes District Council governing the area where the train station is situated, but this does not necessarily mean that the station is within the Lewes district.\n\nHowever, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_528/re-ranker-msmarco/51.txt) mentions \"Newhaven Harbour Station... falls inside the area governed by Lewes District Council.\" This suggests that the station is indeed within the Lewes district, but I will still maintain my initial response based on the primary context information.\n\nIf you want to take into account this additional document, my revised response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`\n\nPlease let me know which one I should stick with."
