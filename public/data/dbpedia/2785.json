The documents instead focus on the battle being a pivotal moment in the history of the Crusades, the defeat of Christian forces by Muslim forces led by Saladin, and the consequences for the Holy Land.\n\nThe documents do mention that the Battle of Hattin marked the end of Christian military dominance in the Holy Land (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2785/re-ranker-msmarco/53.txt), but this is not equivalent to saying the subject of the Battle of Hattin is Conflicts in 1187. The subject is more specifically related to the Crusades and the events surrounding the battle, rather than a broad category like conflicts."
