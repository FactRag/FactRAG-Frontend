However, they do not indicate that traffic reporting is a type of distribution in general. Instead, they seem to use the terms \"distribution\" and \"reporting\" somewhat interchangeably.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that the statement \"Traffic reporting is a type of Distribution.\" is not clearly supported by the documents as a universally true statement.\n\nHere is my response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
