However, one of the documents mentions \"The new Thunderbirds.com website went live on December 19, 2014\", which implies that there is an official website for Thunderbirds, but its URL might be different from what's in your question.\n\nHowever, another document mentions \"Soulpepper Media Gallery: http://www.soulpepper.ca/media/media_gallery\" and \"Thunderbird Media Contact: Nicola Pender, Media & Marketing 604.683.3555 nicola@thunderbird.tv\", which might indicate that Thunderbird Films is somehow related to the domain thunderbird.tv (not necessarily its homepage).\n\nGiven this context, I would say that the information supports the existence of a connection between Thunderbird Films and http://www.thunderbird.tv/, but it's not clear whether it's the homepage. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"maybe\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since you asked me to provide my answer in the format you specified, I will choose the closest possible response based on the information provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

Although there is no explicit homepage URL stated in the given documents, the email domain (`thunderbird.tv`) suggests that a website with a similar domain name could be associated with Thunderbird Films. Therefore, based on the available information and reasonable inference, the triple \"The homepage of Thunderbird Films is http://www.thunderbird.tv/\" can be considered correct."
