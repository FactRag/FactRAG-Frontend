In fact, one document mentions a film called \"Ranger, the Cook and a Hole in the Sky\" which contains some card playing and cigar smoking, but it's not explicitly mentioned to be about black-and-white films. Another document talks about a novel series \"Ranger\u2019s Apprentice\", but again, there is no mention of black-and-white films. The only mention of \"Sky Ranger\" is in a context that has nothing to do with films or genres."
