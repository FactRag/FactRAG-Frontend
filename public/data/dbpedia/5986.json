Blackie wears a suit in most of the film, but disguises himself as a uniformed messenger in a leather jacket at the end.\"\n\nThis suggests that One Mysterious Night is indeed a black-and-white film (specifically, one that takes place during the day and night). However, there is no direct mention of the subject being Black-and-white films. Nevertheless, given the context, we can infer that the triple is correct.\n\nBut to be precise:\n\nThe document contains:\n\"The story deals with many symbols and metaphors, inspired by the surrealistic tradition of Dali and Bu\u00f1uel...\"\n\nIt does not contain a clear statement like \"One Mysterious Night is about black-and-white films\" or \"One Mysterious Night features a subject related to black-and-white films\"."
