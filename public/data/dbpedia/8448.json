This suggests that the statement \"The language used by the United States is the Federal government of the United States\" is incorrect, as it implies a specific language (English) is used by the Federal government, which contradicts the information provided in the documents.\n\nNote: The fact that 30 states have made English their official language does not imply that the Federal government has an official language."
