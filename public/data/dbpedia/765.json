However, while it is mentioned that he was a Knight of Santiago, there is no indication that he belonged to the Knights of Santiago after they were formally known as the Order of Saint James of Compostella (i.e., during the Reconquista period).\n\nIn fact, one document specifically states that Juan de Acu\u00f1a y Bejarano, I Marqu\u00e9s de Casa Fuerte, was a viceroy and not mentioned in relation to the Knights of Santiago after they were founded in the 12th century. Another document mentions him as a member of the Order of Santiago but does not provide further context.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it is not clear whether Juan de Acu\u00f1a, 2nd Marquis of Casa Fuerte, was indeed a subject in the category Knights of Santiago after their formal foundation in the 12th century."

The documents primarily discuss his role as Viceroy of New Spain and some background information about his life but do not provide enough context to confirm or deny his being part of the Knights of Santiago in a direct manner."
