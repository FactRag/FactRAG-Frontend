However, in other documents (8.txt and 31.txt), there are conflicting information about individuals named Thomas or Tom Drechsel.\n\nThe first document (17.txt) provides a clear answer to the query: it's possible to find someone without knowing their last name by looking for marriage records, arrest records, or background checks. However, this is not specific to finding someone without knowing their last name and does not provide an actual method to do so.\n\nTherefore, considering all the documents together, the information in the documents does NOT support the query \"How to find someone without knowing their last name?\" accurately.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
