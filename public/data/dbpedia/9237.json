However, it can be inferred from the context that Bremen was a significant city within the Archbishopric, as mentioned in multiple documents. The fact that \"the city of Bremen\" is often referred to as a separate entity from the Archbishopric suggests that Bremen might have served as a capital or administrative center for the Archbishopric at some point. Therefore, the statement can be considered true based on the provided context."
