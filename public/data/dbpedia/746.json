This suggests that the population demonym of Magliano Vetere could be related to the number 214 or another characteristic of the place, but it does not explicitly state what the demonym is. However, the name \"Maglianesi\" seems like a plausible and grammatically correct demonym for Magliano Vetere, similar to how other Italian cities have their own specific demonyms (e.g., Romans, Venetians). Therefore, based on this analysis, the answer would be affirmative."

While the documents do not explicitly state \"Maglianesi\" as the demonym, it is a reasonable inference based on Italian naming conventions for towns and their inhabitants. Therefore, given the context provided, the statement is supported."
