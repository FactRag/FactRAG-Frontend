However, it does contain a few relevant pieces of information:\n\n* The file path contains names like \"Denis Perger\", which is likely related to the person in question.\n* There is a section about \"Early Notables of the Perger family\" and a list of notable people with the surname Perger, including Denis Perger (b. 1993), who is described as a Slovenian footballer.\n\nBased on this information, I would say that the context supports the triple, but only to a limited extent. The documents do not explicitly confirm that the text is about Slovenian footballers in general, but they do contain specific references to Denis Perger and his profession.\n\nTherefore, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}` (with the caveat that the context provides some indirect support for the triple)"
