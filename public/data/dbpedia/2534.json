    "object": "CKSW (570 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format. Licensed to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, it serves southwestern Saskatchewan. It first began broadcasting in 1956 at 1400 kHz before moving to its current dial position of 570 kHz in 1977. The station is currently owned by Golden West Broadcasting.CKSW 570 celebrated its 50th anniversary in July 2006 with a 1-day music festival in the city's Riverside Park.  Among the performers at the outdoor event was Saskatchewan Born country music star, Brad Johner.  The event was a huge success with over 2000 listeners in attendance.Through the last 50 years, CKSW 570 has been home to several legends in Canadian radio such as Wilf Gilbey, Lenn Enns, Eric Rosenbaum and most notably, Art Wallman who is in the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame.CKSW 570 resides with 2 sister stations; Magic 97.1 FM and the Eagle 94.1FM, in the same building at 134 Central Avenue N. in Swift Current. This arrangement gives the parent company, Golden West Broadcasting a monopoly in the Swift Current radio market. With no local competition, this has led to Golden West Broadcasting cutting many on air positions and features while still being able to raise advertising rates each year. A formula they implement in many other markets.",
