Cocea as an essayist, and in fact, one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8608/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt) mentions that Arghezi edited a magazine called Cronica in collaboration with Galaction, but it does not mention Cocea's work or genre. Another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8608/re-ranker-msmarco/9.txt) mentions that Cocea contributed to Arghezi's early fame by publishing one of his first influential poems, \"Rug\u0103 de sear\u0103\" (\"Evening Prayer\"), but it does not mention the genre of Cocea's work. \n\nHowever, based on other information in the documents, it seems that N.D. Cocea was a writer or novelist, and therefore it is likely that his genre would be novel/writing rather than essay."
