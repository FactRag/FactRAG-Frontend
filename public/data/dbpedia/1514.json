While he is not specifically mentioned as being from Boston, several documents indicate his involvement in political roles in Massachusetts.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Nathaniel Gorham is about politicians from Boston, Massachusetts\" can be loosely considered accurate since Boston is part of Massachusetts and Gorham's significant political activities took place within Massachusetts.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that while he was a politician and merchant from Massachusetts, there isn't definitive evidence in the provided texts stating that Nathaniel Gorham was specifically from Boston. He could have been from another city or town in Massachusetts.\n\nGiven these considerations, the closest fitting answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis is because the statement specifies \"from Boston,\" which is not explicitly confirmed by the given documents."
