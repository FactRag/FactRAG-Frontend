However, none of these sources directly state that the full name of Emile Vandervelde is \"Vandervelde, Emile\", which would imply that \"Emile\" is his first name and \"Vandervelde\" is his last name. In fact, some sources provide his first name as \"Emile Auguste\" (from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5175/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt). Therefore, the triple is incorrect according to the documents."
