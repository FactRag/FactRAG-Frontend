However, one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2439/re-ranker-msmarco/64.txt) mentions her birthdate and does not provide a first name, suggesting that the information provided may be incomplete or incorrect."

According to the details in the documents, Rose Tremain was born as Rosemary Jane Thomson, which contradicts the statement that her given name is Rose. Therefore, the query \"The given name of Rose Tremain is Rose\" is incorrect based on the provided context information."
