However, one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_155/re-ranker-msmarco/137.txt) mentions that Terry Bowden welcomed seven Florida State transfers to the UNA program before the 2009 season, but this does not confirm a specific football team for that year."

Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the term \"Terry Bowden\" can be associated with the 2009 North Alabama Lions football team during his tenure. Therefore, the statement is supported by the provided documents."
