However, since his birthplace is specifically mentioned as Charleston, South Carolina, I can infer that he was not born in a state other than South Carolina.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning and the available context information, the answer to the query would be:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}\n\nThis indicates that the triple \"Frank Lebby Stanton was born in United States\" is supported by the documents."
