The closest thing related to olive oil is the movie \"Love Under the Olive Tree\", but it's not from the 1910s, and there's no information about a specific documentary film on olives and their oil from that era."

The documents are primarily about movies (\"Love Under the Olive Tree\") and an interactive experience related to olive trees, but they do not reference a documentary film from the early 20th century."
