Specifically, the passage states:\n\n- \"At that time the Hungarian 4x100 relay was already formed, in which from 1951 Gy\u00f6rgy Cs\u00e1nyi and B\u00e9la Goldov\u00e1nyi started alongside Zar\u00e1ndi and Varasdi, and received the name \u201clightning sticks\u201d.\"\n- The team won \"the bronze medal at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, behind the United States and the Soviet Union,\" which confirms that Gy\u00f6rgy Cs\u00e1nyi was part of a successful Hungarian relay team.\n\nThus, the information in the documents supports the statement that Gy\u00f6rgy Cs\u00e1nyi won a bronze medal in the men's 4x100 metres relay event at the 1952 Summer Olympics."
