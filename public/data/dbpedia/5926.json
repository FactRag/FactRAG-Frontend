However, it does not mention anything about links to related articles. We also find another document mentioning the manifesto and policies of Plaid Cymru, but there's no mention of \"links to related articles\".\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, I conclude that:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'no'}\n\nThe reason is that the documents do not provide any evidence or information about Plaid Cymru having links to related articles."
