Additionally, it mentions \"Our Lady of the Artichokes & Other Portuguese-American Stories\" indicating she has written non-fiction (specifically collections of stories), and while there is no explicit mention of children's literature in these documents, her work spans various forms, which can imply a range including potentially children\u2019s stories given the breadth of her writing.
