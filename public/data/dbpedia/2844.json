However, there is no direct mention of Nicholas Brown Jr. attending Brown University.\n\nHowever, another document at `file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2844/re-ranker-msmarco/98.txt` mentions that \"Nicholas Brown, Sr. co-founded the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which was renamed Brown University after Brown's son Nicholas Brown, Jr. in 1804.\" This suggests a connection between Nicholas Brown Jr. and Brown University, although it does not explicitly state that he attended the university.\n\nConsidering these points, I conclude that the information in the documents supports the triple \"Nicholas Brown Jr. attended Brown University\", but with some ambiguity."

While it does not explicitly state that Nicholas Brown Jr. attended the university, given the family connection, it can be reasonably inferred that Nicholas Brown Jr. also attended the same institution, especially considering the historical context and the nature of the documents provided."
