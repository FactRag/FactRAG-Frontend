For instance:\n\n- The Dakota Writing Project (DWP) and Vermillion Literary Project are affiliated with USD, which is likely University of South Dakota.\n- There's a reference to \"South Dakota\" in association with DWP.\n- Some activities like writing workshops for students from South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska also imply the camp could be based in or at least involve the United States.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to infer that The Writing Camp mentioned might indeed be located in the United States."
