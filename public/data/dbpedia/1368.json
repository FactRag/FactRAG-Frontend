However, they do not explicitly state that Lasse M\u00e5rtenson's surname is spelled \"Martenson\". In fact, the documents consistently spell his surname as \"M\u00e5rtenson\" (with an \"\u00e4\") or one of its variants (\"Mortensson\", \"Mortenson\"). While it might be a typographical error to write \"Martenson\" instead of \"M\u00e5rtenson\", the information provided suggests that Lasse M\u00e5rtenson indeed had this surname."
