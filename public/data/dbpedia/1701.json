However, it also does not provide any information about the cover art.\n\nGiven that none of the documents provide any information about the cover art of the album \"The Troublemaker\" by Willie Nelson, let alone specify a filename like \"Willie-Nelson-Troublemaker-Cover.jpg\", I conclude that the statement is not supported by the documents.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
