His lower range is strong enough for his placement, however it is very underused.\"\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1361/re-ranker-msmarco/70.txt, Andrea Ferro's voice type is not specifically mentioned.\n\n**Conclusion:** The information in the documents supports that Andrea Ferro can use Death growl/distortion technique as part of his vocal style, but it does not explicitly state that this is his primary or only voice type. Therefore:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
