In fact, one of the documents states that James George Stopford, 3rd Earl of Courtown (also referred to as Viscount Stopford) was the eldest son of James Stopford, 2nd Earl of Courtown, and his wife Mary (n\u00e9e Powys)."

However, there is no indication that Edward Stopford was a parent of James Stopford, 2nd Earl of Courtown. Instead, the provided context suggests that Edward Stopford might be one of the children of James George Stopford, 3rd Earl of Courtown (as he died in 1840 and was born in 1795), whereas James Stopford, 2nd Earl of Courtown lived before him. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the given documents."
