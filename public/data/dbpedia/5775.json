The earliest possible date mentioned is between April 9 and 14, while the latest possible date is also not specified in the given context. However, one document states that he was executed \"in the early morning of Sunday 15 April 1945\", which suggests that the execution took place on this day. Nevertheless, considering the phrase \"in the early morning of Sunday 15 April 1945\" and not explicitly stating that it happened at a time before midnight (or even specifying an exact hour), we cannot be certain if the event occurred on the 15th or during the late hours of the previous night."
