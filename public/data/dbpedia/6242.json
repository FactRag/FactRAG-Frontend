However, this does not directly match the coordinates (26.335, -80.26527777777778), as the latitude and longitude of Boca Raton, Florida are approximately 26.3212\u00b0 N and 80.0997\u00b0 W.\n\nThe second document provides more information about WSBR's location, stating that it is licensed to \"Boca Raton, Florida, USA\" and serves the West Palm Beach/Boca Raton radio markets, with the Miami/Fort Lauderdale market as a secondary.\n\nHowever, there is no direct mention of coordinates in any of the documents. The third document mentions a different entity called WSBR Realty Private Limited, which has an office location in Pune, India.\n\nGiven this information, I would conclude that the triple \"WSBR is located at point (26.335, -80.26527777777778)\" does not have direct support from the provided documents.
