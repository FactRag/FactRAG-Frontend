However, it also mentions that he \"overcoming the limitations of Arte Povera itself and taking conceptualist art a step ahead\". This implies that his style is not limited to conventional conceptual art, but rather, it's a fusion with other artistic movements. \n\nWhile the documents do not explicitly state that Orellana's movement is post-conceptual, they suggest that he has evolved beyond traditional conceptualism, incorporating elements of figuration and aesthetic play. This evolution implies that his style may have transcended into what could be considered post-conceptual art, where the boundaries between different artistic movements are blurred. \n\nTherefore, based on this inference, the response is \"yes\"."
