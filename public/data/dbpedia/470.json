Additionally, one of the documents mentions that Phillips attended the Moseley Road Secondary School of Art in Birmingham, suggesting that this might be an earlier educational institution where he received training.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the triple specifically asks if Peter Phillips \"received training\" at the Birmingham School of Art, which is a slightly different phrasing than the documents. But given the context and the information provided, it seems reasonable to interpret this as referring to his education or training at the institution.\n\nSo, based on the evaluation, the output is set to \"yes\"."
