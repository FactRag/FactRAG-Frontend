Lazio in 2011, but it does not specify whether he still plays for them at the time of writing. In fact, one document mentions that Emmanuel was playing for Swedish lower league for 2015, which suggests that he may have left S.S. Lazio by then.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection of the provided context information, I found that another document explicitly states: \"In 2011, after trials at several clubs in Europe, Emmanuel signed for Italian Serie A side S.S.  Lazio where he was immediately put into their Primavera side.\" This suggests that Emmanuel did indeed sign with S.S. Lazio in 2011 and may still be associated with them.\n\nGiven the information provided, I revise my previous answer to:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n\nSo, according to the context information, it appears that Sani Emmanuel does play for or has played for S.S. Lazio at some point in time."
