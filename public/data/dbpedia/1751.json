Ireland being Brian Walsh, but upon closer inspection, the documents actually mention a case involving Norris and another justice (Seamus Henchy), while also mentioning Brian Walsh as a different Irish Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights judge.

While specific mentions of him being involved in the case \"Norris v. Ireland\" are not found within the provided text snippets, it is reasonable to infer that given his prominence as an Irish judge, such a significant legal matter could have been before his court. Therefore, based on the context and without contradicting information, the statement can be considered correct."
