The whole idea of a whole town blacking out was \u2018Wow!\u2019 Also, I somehow got this incredible crush on one of the girls in the original,\u201d the remake director says of the original movie.\" \nThis quote implies that John Carpenter directed a remake of the 1960 film, but it does not say he wrote it.
