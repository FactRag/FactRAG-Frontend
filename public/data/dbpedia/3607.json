Public administration in the marzes is governed by RA President\u2019s decree \u201cOn public administration in the marzes of the Republic of Armenia\u201d and other legal acts.\"\n\nMarz governors implement the regional policy of the government. They coordinate the activities of local branches of the executive authority, except as otherwise specified by law.\n\nThis text indicates that \"marze\" (also referred to as \"region\") is a subdivision type in Administrative divisions of Armenia.\n\nTherefore:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"

However, it's important to note that \"Aghbulagh\" was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but given the nature of the question and the information about provincial divisions, we can infer that such administrative subdivisions exist within Armenia. Therefore, the statement is supported by the document's information on Armenia\u2019s administrative structure."
