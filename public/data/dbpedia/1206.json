In fact, the documents mention that Dick Van Dyke (not Barry) has Dutch ancestry and that his surname is Dutch for a person who lives near a dyke or levee. However, it is also mentioned that Dick Van Dyke has English ancestry as well, and one of his English forebears came to America on the Mayflower.
