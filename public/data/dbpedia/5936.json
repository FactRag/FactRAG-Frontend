According to the documents, there are mentions of councillors from both Conservative and Labour parties being involved with the NLWA, but it does not specify that the leader of the authority is a member of the Labour Party. In fact, one of the councillors mentioned as part of the NLWA's board is Cllr Rowena Champion, who is described as \"the Town Hall's environment chief\" and no party affiliation is specified for her."
