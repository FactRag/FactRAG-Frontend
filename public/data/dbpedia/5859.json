In fact, the documents suggest that Sunday Silence and other horses are part of the same sire line as Hail To Reason.\n\nHowever, the fourth document does mention that \"Halo had to be pretty special to rank among such company among the sons of Hail to Reason.\" This implies that Halo is a notable son of Hail to Reason, but it does not provide information about Sunny's Halo being involved in this line.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would conclude that the triple \"Sunny's Halo is the grand sire of Hail To Reason\" is likely incorrect according to the provided documents. Therefore:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
