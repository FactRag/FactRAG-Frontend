Since the documents mention various botanists and naturalists with names starting with \"Gra\", such as Hornemann and Kunth, but not specifically \"Grassmel\" or \"Franz\", I will conclude that the provided context does not confirm the correctness of this statement.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
