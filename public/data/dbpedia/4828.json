In particular, the text states that \"Someone to Watch Over Me is a great hidden gem out of his career.\" (document 2) and \"SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME represents a definite turning point in Scott\u2019s career\u2014\" (document 4). This suggests that Ridley Scott directed the film \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", which is consistent with the triple."
