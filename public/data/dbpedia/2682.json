The taxonomy mentions that it belongs to the order Lepidoptera, which suggests that Cratoptera also belongs to this order. Therefore, the triple is supported by the documents.\n\nNote: There are multiple mentions of the order Lepidoptera in the provided context information, and they all confirm that Cratoptera brunnea (and likely other Cratoptera species) belong to this order."
