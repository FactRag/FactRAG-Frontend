For example, one document mentions that the Eckbach rises in the Palatinate Forest near Carlsberg-Hertlingshausen and flows through the Leiningerland to eventually empty into the Upper Rhine Plain, where it meets the Rhine river at Worms. This suggests a connection between the Eckbach and the Rhine river system."
