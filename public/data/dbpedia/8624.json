According to file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8624/re-ranker-msmarco/39.txt, Arthur Shirley (not Anderson) was born on 31 August 1886 in Hobart... but according to another document, file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8624/re-ranker-msmarco/33.txt, a different Arthur Anderson was indeed born in British India. However, in the context of the provided files, it is the latter that seems to be more relevant when searching for birth place information about an individual named \"Arthur Anderson\"."
