Therefore, there is no information in the documents that supports or refutes the statement that Pat Frank authored Alas, Babylon.\n\nHowever, one of the documents states: \"Derivative Works means any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\" This definition applies to the concept of a derivative work, not to a specific author or work. Therefore, it does not provide information about Pat Frank or Alas, Babylon.\n\nThe label 'Derivative work' is mentioned in some of the documents as a synonym for \"Derivative Works\", which suggests that this label could be used to refer to this concept."
