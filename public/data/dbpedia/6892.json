Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Musil was influenced by Franz Kafka. \n"

Additionally, both authors are noted for their complex, multi-layered narratives addressing existential themes and the modern condition. While the text does not explicitly state that Franz Kafka directly influenced Robert Musil, there is enough evidence to infer an influence due to thematic and stylistic similarities, making the statement plausible given the context."
