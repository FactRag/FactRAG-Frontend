It mentions that \"After the fall of the Crusader states, the knights relocated and continued their fight against the Muslims.\"\n* The file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5798/re-ranker-msmarco/90.txt mentions that \"The Knights Hospitaller started to erect a series of fortifications in today\u2019s Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Turkey after they gained the castle of Bayt Jibrin or Bethgibelin as a donation in 1136.\" However, it does not explicitly mention Jerusalem.\n* The file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5798/re-ranker-msmarco/151.txt mentions that \"The work of the Knights Hospitaller was extended beyond Jerusalem, and Hospitals were founded in the principal seaports of Europe, where pilgrims were received on their way to Palestine.\" This suggests that while Jerusalem is mentioned as a location where the Order was initially established, it does not necessarily mean that the garrison was located there.\n\nConsidering this information, I conclude that the triple \"The garrison of Knights Hospitaller is in Jerusalem\" is not entirely supported by the documents. While Jerusalem is connected to the Order's early history and establishment, there is no explicit mention of a garrison being stationed there. Therefore:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"

While it mentions that the Knights Hospitallers were initially headquartered in Jerusalem, it does not specify that a permanent garrison was always there or at any particular point in time after they relocated to other places like Rhodes and Malta."
