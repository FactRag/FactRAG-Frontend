However, it is never explicitly stated or implied that Voruta was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In fact, one source suggests that Voruta may have been the first capital of Lithuania, while others question its existence as an actual city.

Some sources suggest that Voruta may have been the capital during Mindaugas's reign in the 13th century, while others argue that it might just be an interpretation or misinterpretation of words related to a capital.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, we cannot definitively conclude from these documents alone whether \"The capital of Grand Duchy of Lithuania is Voruta\" is correct. However, since the query asks for evaluation based on support in the given documents and considering that some sources suggest it could be so (while others dispute it), we lean towards acknowledging the possibility as implied by certain sentences.\n\nThus, the appropriate response would acknowledge limited support from the provided information while recognizing the lack of conclusive evidence:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThe value is \"no\" because although Voruta may have been considered a capital city by some historical accounts, there isn't definitive proof in the documents that it was officially recognized as such universally or consistently throughout the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania."
