The document also mentions that each member of the Presidency and members of the Parliament's Upper house have veto powers, and there is proportionality in representation.\n\nThe document `file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7581/re-ranker-msmarco/30.txt` specifically mentions that the House of Peoples has 15 members with 5 Bosniaks, 5 Croats, and 5 Serbs. This matches the triple being evaluated.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, the answer is \"yes\"."
