According to some of these documents (e.g., files 19.txt and 36.txt), Andrei Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in Ivanovo Oblast, not specifically in the Russian SFSR, Soviet Union.\n\nIn particular:\n\n* File 19.txt states that Tarkovsky was \"born in the village of Zavrazhye in Ivanovo Oblast.\"\n* File 36.txt states that Tarkovsky was \"born in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yuryevetsky District of the Ivanovo Industrial Oblast (modern-day Kadyysky District of the Kostroma Oblast, Russia)\".\n\nTherefore, while it is true that Andrei Tarkovsky was born in Zavrazhye, Russia, the additional information from these documents makes the statement \"Andrei Tarkovsky was born in Zavrazhye, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union\" not entirely accurate. Hence, the response is \"no\"."

While they do not explicitly mention the Russian SFSR and Soviet Union, given the context, it can be reasonably inferred that his birthplace is indeed in what would later become part of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the statement aligns with the information provided."
