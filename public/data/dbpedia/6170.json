The closest information related to faculty size comes from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6170/re-ranker-msmarco/48.txt, which mentions \"244\" as the 1L class size and a yield of \"35.43%\", but it does not provide information on the total faculty size.\n\nHowever, file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6170/re-ranker-msmarco/72.txt mentions various departments with their respective employees count (e.g., Duke Primary Care has 1,520 employees), but again, it does not provide a total faculty size for the university. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the statement \"Duke University has a faculty size of 3398\", and thus the answer should be \"no\"."
