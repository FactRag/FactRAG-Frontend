In document 113.txt, it is mentioned that \"Children and adults greet her with a drawn out, almost sung greeting of \u2018Mam Beck\u2019 as they pass her home located on the main street.\" This suggests that this Marie-Magdeleine has a nickname 'Mam Beck'. However, in document 26.txt, it is mentioned that \"Marie-Magdeleine, daughter of Joseph Boucher and Marie Madeleine Baillarjon, was born and baptized on 31 May 1767 at Berthierville.\" This suggests that this Marie-Magdeleine is a historical figure.\n\nSince the two Marie-Magdelaines are different individuals with distinct characteristics, it is not accurate to say that Marie-Magdeleine is also known as Marie-Magdeleine.
