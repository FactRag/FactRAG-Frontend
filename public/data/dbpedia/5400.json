However, since there are multiple mentions of \"Beyond the Farthest Star\" in different contexts without specifying its language, it's possible that the information is not explicitly stated but could be inferred.\n\nBut, to follow the format you requested:\n\n\n{ \"output\": \"no\" }"

This suggests that the subject matter is related to religious or Christian themes within an English-speaking context, thus supporting the triple that the subject of the film 'Beyond the Farthest Star' is English-language films."
