The other information provided (starring Jimmy Hanley as newcomer PC Mitchell and a very young Dirk Bogarde as hardened criminal Tom Riley) is also consistent with the documents.\n\nHowever, I noticed that there are multiple files in the context information. It seems like you're expecting a single answer for this triple based on all the files, so I'm assuming that's the case. If each file had different information about The Blue Lamp, it would be a different story!\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!"
