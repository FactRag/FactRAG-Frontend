While there are mentions of a character named Ulrika being from a place with a similar name, none of the documents mention Romuald himself as being from France. In fact, one document explicitly states that the show aired on the BBC, which is based in the UK, and another document mentions a Christmas reindeer, suggesting a more general or traditional European setting rather than specifically France."

It aired on BBC One and was created for British audiences."
