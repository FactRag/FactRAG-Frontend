For example, from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5181/re-ranker-msmarco/34.txt, we can see that \"Ellis County is located in north Central Texas and shares its borders with Dallas County to the north...\". Additionally, from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5181/re-ranker-msmarco/56.txt, we can see that \"Waxahachie, the largest town and county seat, is on Interstate Highway 35E thirty miles south of Dallas\", which implies that Ellis County is south of Dallas County."

They state that Dallas County is to the north of Ellis County, while Waxahachie (the county seat of Ellis County) is south of Dallas. Therefore, the statement \"Dallas County, Texas is south of Ellis County, Texas\" is incorrect based on the provided context."
