In fact, one document mentions a different birthdate and location for Lottie Williams, which seems to be inconsistent with another document that also lists multiple facts about an actress named Lottie Williams.\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided, I would say that:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
