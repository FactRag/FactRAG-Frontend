For instance, the film revolves around characters like Leslie Hatten and Rose who are described as living in a small town called Evergreen, which is implied to be set in the United States (as it mentions the Great War, which refers to World War I, and the setting of the story including the specific details about small-town life). Additionally, the involvement of Howard Hughes, an American film producer, and his Caddo Corporation also indicates a U.S. setting for much of the production and distribution activities related to the film."
