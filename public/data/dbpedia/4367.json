The specific date and location of his death are mentioned as July 17, 1996, at Newcastle General Hospital, which suggests that the city is Newcastle, but the country is implied to be England or the UK, rather than Newcastle upon Tyne (which could refer to a place in Northumberland). However, given that Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle City Council are mentioned as places associated with Chas Chandler's life and death, it is likely that Newcastle upon Tyne refers to the city where he passed away. \n\nTherefore, based on this context, it can be inferred that the triple is correct, but the output should have a more nuanced explanation:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
