In one of the files (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_541/re-ranker-msmarco/3.txt), it is mentioned that \"While most postcards in circulation are rodeo action shots taken by John.\" Additionally, in file 48 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_541/re-ranker-msmarco/48.txt), it says \"We followed the links and arrived at Wayne's Flickr hosted photo archive...\", but then switches to describing Wayne's photo collection. However, in file 3, John is mentioned again as a photographer. The context suggests that John Helfrich has taken many photos, which indicates he does have a photo collection."
