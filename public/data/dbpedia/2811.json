The document from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2811/re-ranker-msmarco/28.txt specifically states that Major General Frank Miller (US Army, Ret.) is a great example of how a military background can transform an organization in the civilian sector, and it quotes Frank L. Miller, Jr., saying \"For 32 years the Army was my profession,\" indicating that he served for 32 years in the US Army, not the RCAF or any other branch of service. However, another document from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2811/re-ranker-msmarco/71.txt specifically states that Frank Miller served as a Private (Priv.) in Company B, Regiment 24 during the Civil War, which would be consistent with being in the Union Army. \n\nSo while there is some ambiguity and inconsistency across different documents, it seems likely that Frank Miller did serve in the Union Army during the Civil War, making the triple \"yes\"."

Additionally, the `71.txt` document explicitly lists Frank Miller as having served in the Infantry of the Union Army during the Civil War. Therefore, the information supports that Frank Miller served in the Union Army."
