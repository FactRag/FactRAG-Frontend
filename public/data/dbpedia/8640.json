While it is indeed a book called \"Princess Academy\", its label or categorization might be better represented as something like \"fantasy\", \"coming-of-age story\", or \"middle grade novel\" rather than simply \"Princess Academy\". The documents highlight the book's themes of education, community, friendship, and self-discovery, which are not necessarily captured by the title alone."
