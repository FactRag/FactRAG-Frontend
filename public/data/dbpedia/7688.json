However, there are mentions of individuals with the name Zygmunt or Kazimierz (Polish variant of Casimir) Vetulani, but they seem to be different people. One is a diplomat and economist who lived in the 1940s, another is a professor of technical computer science born in 1950, and there's also an engineer and construction theorist born in 1889 who was active in the first half of the 20th century. None of these individuals are described as mathematicians."
