In fact, one of the documents explicitly states that the 1931 and 1953 films are different, but the language of the 1953 film is not mentioned.\n\nBut then, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_460/re-ranker-msmarco/79.txt) mentions that \"Salto Mortale\" is a 1953 West German drama film directed by Viktor Tourjansky and starring Margot Hielscher, Philip Dorn and Karlheinz B\u00f6hm. This document does not specify the language.\n\nHowever, another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_460/re-ranker-msmarco/3.txt) mentions that \"Salto Mortale (1931 French film)\" is recorded in French language. This suggests that the 1931 and 1953 films are different, and the 1953 film might be in German.\n\nGiven this information, I'm inclined to say that the statement about the language of the 1953 film \"Salto Mortale\" being German is not explicitly supported by the documents. However, it's also not explicitly contradicted. The most conservative answer would be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

According to the provided information, the 1953 film \"Salto Mortale\" is a West German drama film, not a French film as might be inferred from the query. The language of the 1953 film was likely German, but this specific detail is not explicitly confirmed in all documents, and importantly, it contradicts the query's statement that the language is German (which could be interpreted as confirming the language without specifying which year). Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively state the language with certainty for the 1953 film alone. However, the key issue here is the discrepancy between a French and German origin, making the answer \"no.\""
