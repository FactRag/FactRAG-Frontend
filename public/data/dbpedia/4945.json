(file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4945/re-ranker-msmarco/39.txt)\n* It also mentions that they finished their home games in Caledonian Ground as well as Forsyth Barr Stadium, but not Dave Farrington Park. (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4945/re-ranker-msmarco/144.txt)\n* However, it does mention that Team Wellington FC represents 20 clubs in the Greater Wellington region and their home games are not specified to be played at Dave Farrington Park. (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4945/re-ranker-msmarco/138.txt)\n\nTherefore, the statement is not supported by the documents, so the answer is \"no\"."
