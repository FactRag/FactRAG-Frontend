However, there is no mention that it was the capital or primary seat of the Archbishopric of Bremen during its existence from 1223-1648. The documents indicate that after the merger with the Archbishopric of Hamburg and subsequent disputes, the archbishops began to stay increasingly out of town, eventually settling in their main castle at Voerde (today known as Bremerv\u00f6rde). Thus, while Bremerv\u00f6rde is a significant place associated with the later history, it was not explicitly stated or strongly implied as the capital during the Archbishopric's primary period."
