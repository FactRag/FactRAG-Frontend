The information mentions that the film is in Hebrew language, but it also states that it has subtitles in Dutch and Polish (indicating that it may have been released or screened internationally). However, the primary subject of the film appears to be a narrative about survivors of the Holocaust and their experiences, rather than specifically being categorized as \"Hebrew-language films\"."
