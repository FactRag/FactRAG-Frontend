Specifically, one of the documents states, \"The warmest month (with the highest average high temperature) is August (24.9\u00b0C).\" Another document mentions that \"In Leipzig, the summers are comfortable; the winters are long, very cold, snowy, and windy.\" While it does not explicitly state an average high of 19 degrees for May, the information provided supports that temperatures in Leipzig can be around 19\u00b0C during warmer months, as this is within the range of temperatures reported (e.g., August's high of 24.9\u00b0C). Therefore, the statement that \"The average high temperature in Leipzig may be around 19 degrees\" can be considered supported by the context information provided."
