John S. Fake of Lansingburgh, New York\n* Nicholas Fake, born in Pittstown, Rensselaer County, New York\n* George J. Fake, who arrived in San Francisco around 1850\n\nHowever, none of these individuals are explicitly mentioned as being from Cobleskill, New York. In fact, the document mentions several places where the Fakes lived or settled, including Brunswick (now Centre Brunswick), Pittstown, Albany County, New York, Lansingburgh, Rensselaer County, New York, and Fulton, Kentucky.\n\nBased on this information, I conclude that the statement \"Guy Leverne Fake is a subject of Category:People from Cobleskill, New York\" is not supported by the documents.
