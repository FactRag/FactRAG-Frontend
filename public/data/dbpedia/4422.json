However, based on the provided context, I can answer the query about The chapter of Sigma Pi being Alpha-Sigma, University of Arkansas.\n\nGiven the information in the documents:\n\n* File_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4422/re-ranker-msmarco/47.txt contains a mention of the Interfraternity Council and its chapters at the University of Arkansas. Some chapters mentioned include Alpha Gamma Rho, Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Alpha Order, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and others.\n* File_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4422/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt mentions the Epsilon Kappa Chapter of Sigma Pi Fraternity, International, which was founded at Southern Arkansas University (not University of Arkansas). However, this does not rule out the possibility that there is an Alpha-Sigma chapter at the University of Arkansas.\n* File_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4422/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt contains information about the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, including its Alpha Chapter at the University of Arkansas (not Sigma Pi).\n \nBased on this analysis, I would conclude that there is not enough explicit information in the provided documents to confirm or deny the triple statement \"The chapter of Sigma Pi is Alpha-Sigma, University of Arkansas.\" The answer could be either yes or no depending on other available information.\n\nHowever, assuming that this query is related to the specific context given and aiming to provide a response based on that context:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'no'}"
