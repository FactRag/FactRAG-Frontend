However, a closer look at each document reveals that one mentions the elections as being part of \"a big election year in Spain\" in 2015 (document 102), another mentions Podemos and Ciudadanos as new parties rising to power after the EU parliament elections, Sunday's Andalusian elections, and consecutive opinion polls have shown that Spain's party system has been rocked (document 102), and a third document explicitly states that the regional vote on March 22 was seen as a key test ahead of the country's most unpredictable general election in decades later in 2015. Given this context, it is clear that the start date of the Andalusian parliamentary election being referenced is indeed in 2015, not some other year."

Specifically, multiple documents mention that regional elections in Andalusia took place on March 22, 2015. For instance, one of the documents states: \"The Andalusian regional elections held on March 22 were the first of a series of key elections in Spain throughout the course of 2015.\" This clearly supports the query regarding the start date of the Andalusian parliamentary election in 2015 being March 22, 2015."
