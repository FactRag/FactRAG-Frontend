However, there are some discrepancies:\n\n* The abstract states that Fifth Avenue stretches from Washington Square North to West 143rd Street, while the documents indicate that it starts at Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village.\n* There is no mention of it stretching from Washington Square North.\n\nConsidering these points, I would evaluate the triple as follows:\n\n\n{'output': 'no'}\n\nWhile some aspects of the abstract description are accurate, others contain inaccuracies or omissions."
