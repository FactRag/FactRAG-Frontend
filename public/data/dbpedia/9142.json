However, it does not specify that the currency of French Algeria was exclusively the French franc (it mentions \"the franc was the Algerian currency\"). Additionally, after getting rid of the French colonist, the Dinar was established as the national and main monetary unit of Algeria. Therefore, the statement \"The currency of French Algeria is French franc\" is not entirely accurate according to the documents provided."
