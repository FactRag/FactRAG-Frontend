For example:\n\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6172/re-ranker-msmarco/47.txt\n  - It states that Duke University is a \"large private university\".\n* file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6172/re-ranker-msmarco/61.txt\n  - It describes Duke University as a \"private institution\".\n\nTherefore, the information in the documents supports the statement that Duke University is a private university."
