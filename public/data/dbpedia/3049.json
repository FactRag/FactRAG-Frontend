Additionally, another document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3049/re-ranker-msmarco/8.txt provides detailed information about King Baudouin's birthplace as Laeken, Brussels, Belgium, which is a different location than the other two. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Prince Baudouin of Belgium was born in Belgium with certainty based on these documents.\n\nNote: The correct file_path for each document should have been specified, but since you only provided the paths without specifying the actual file contents, I assumed the file_path was correct and focused on evaluating the information within each file. If there were any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the file_paths themselves, please let me know."
