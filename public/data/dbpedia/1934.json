The text mentions that he was the first farm director of the expansion Washington Senators (in both files), and that during his time as farm director, he assumed broad responsibilities, effectively serving as both director of scouting and player development. This suggests that Hal Keller has been involved in Major League Baseball as a farm director, making the triple statement correct according to the documents."
