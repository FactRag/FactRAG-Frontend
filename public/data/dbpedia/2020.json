It does not say she held this position since 2011.\n* **Missing Publications:** While the text mentions several publications where Lindsay Pollock worked, it doesn't list \"Art Review\".\n\nLet me know if you have any other triples to evaluate!"

Document 35 mentions that she was named Editor-in-Chief by Brant Publications, replacing Marcia Vetrocq, but does not provide a specific year for her assuming this role. Additionally, document 31 indicates that she is Chief Communications and Content Director at the Whitney Museum of American Art and formerly Editor-in-Chief of Art in America, suggesting that she may have held this position after serving as editor-in-chief of Art in America magazine.\n\nThe provided triple specifies that Lindsay Pollock served as editor-in-chief of Art in America magazine since 2011. However, based on the information provided by the documents, it is unclear whether her tenure as editor-in-chief started before or after 2011.\n\nIf I consider only the exact wording and facts presented in the documents (without inferring additional details not specified), then the correct answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if we interpret the statement more liberally to mean that Lindsay Pollock was a journalist and blogger specializing in the art market who served as editor-in-chief of Art in America magazine at some point after 2005 (which is consistent with document 26), then:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind that my interpretation is subjective, and I provide both possible answers based on the information provided."
