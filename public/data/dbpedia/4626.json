However, considering he graduated from the Faculty of Philology in Belgrade and worked with various theater houses in the former Yugoslav territories (Jugoslovensko dramsko pozori\u0161te, Bitef Theater, etc.), it can be inferred that he might have some connection to the region.\n* The text mentions \"former Yugoslav territories\" but does not explicitly state his ethnicity. There's a passage about Koprivica being one of the highly appreciated essayists, dramaturgists, and literary critics in these former territories, which implies some cultural association.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"maybe\"\n}\n```"
