Instead, they seem to be part of the text about the Academy Award nomination and film festivals.\n* Document 3 mentions \"A Catalyst Media Productions release\", which implies a US-based company, but this is still not directly stating that the film is from the United States.\n\nHowever, I also found:\n\n* Document 5 mentions that The War at Home is a drama war film directed by Emilio Estevez and released in 1996. While it doesn't explicitly state the country of origin, the fact that it was written by James Duff and based on his play \"Homefront\", which might be an American work, could imply some connection to the US.\n\nGiven this information, I would say:\n\n```json\n{'output': 'yes'}\n```\n\nHowever, please note that my confidence level in this answer is relatively low due to the lack of explicit information in the documents."
