In document /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4554/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt, it's mentioned that \"Endelave is a Danish island...\". This implies that the name \"Endelave\" itself refers to the label of this specific island."

Therefore, the triple is supported by the information provided."
