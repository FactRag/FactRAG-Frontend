However, they do provide information on annual precipitation and monthly temperature ranges, but not specifically for March. The only relevant information related to precipitation is from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4040/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt which mentions \"moderate rainfall, averaging around 71 mm for the month\" in March but this is in millimeters and not inches."

While one document states that Llano, TX gets around 30 inches of rain per year (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4040/re-ranker-msmarco/56.txt), it does not specify the exact amount for March. Therefore, the statement that Llano, Texas receives an average of 1.9 inches of March precipitation is not supported by the given context."
