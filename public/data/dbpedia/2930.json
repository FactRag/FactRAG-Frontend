The definition of an S-Bahn system mentions that it's a type of passenger train service that stops at all existing stations on mainline networks inside and around a city, and this description fits the context of the S-train system in Copenhagen. Therefore, the triple \"Svanem\u00f8llen station is a type of List of S-train stations\" is supported by the information in the documents."
