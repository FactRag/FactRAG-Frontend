In fact, there is no mention of German being the language of Contao, but rather a specific book collection within the Contao project."

This indirectly supports the idea that German is one of the supported languages for content creation within Contao, even though it does not explicitly state that German is the sole language used by Contao itself. However, given the nature of the query and the context provided, we can infer that the statement \"The language of Contao is German\" aligns with the available information in a broader sense related to content creation within the CMS."
