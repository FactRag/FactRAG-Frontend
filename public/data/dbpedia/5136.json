However, there is no indication that the New York Yankees are a former subsidiary of CBS Corporation. In fact, the documents describe the Yankees as a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in The Bronx, New York City, and owned by the Steinbrenner family since 1973. Therefore, the triple does not accurately reflect the information provided in the documents."
