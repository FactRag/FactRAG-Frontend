Davis, Jr. graduated from West Point in 1936, but they also indicate that he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1936 and later joined the flying training program at Tuskegee, which started in July 1941. This suggests that his service years were not limited to 1936, but rather spanned several years including 1936, 1941, and beyond."
