However, multiple documents mention that he died in Charlestown, Massachusetts (which could be confused with Charlestown, a part of Boston). Since \"Charlestown\" can refer to both the town and the neighborhood within Boston, without specific clarification, we should lean towards the information given: Nathaniel Gorham died in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Therefore, the statement is not accurate as it specifically states \"Boston\".\n\nThe answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nIf further research shows that Charlestown, Massachusetts and Charlestown, Boston are considered synonymous for historical contexts, then this might need re-evaluation based on additional context.
