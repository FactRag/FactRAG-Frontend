Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that `Cercospora apii` also belongs to this order.\n\nSo, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"

This can be inferred from the line: \"Phylogenetic analyses of a variety of Cercospora species have placed them as a well-defined clade in the teleomorph genus Mycosphaerella.\" Since Mycosphaerella is part of Capnodiales, this supports the statement that Cercospora apii belongs to the order Capnodiales."
