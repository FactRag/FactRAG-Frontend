The first entry states his death date as May 7, 1993, while the second entry also mentions the same death date, suggesting it might be a repetition or an error in recording rather than indicating two different individuals. Therefore, based on the provided context, there isn't sufficient information to conclude that the statement is wrong; however, if forced to choose and considering potential data duplication issues, one could argue the claim should specify which Duane Carter (with the exact same details) this refers to as the second entry does not provide additional contradicting facts.",
