While it is true that the film Lan Yu is about a love story between two men in Beijing, and the documents mention Beijing and mainland China, they also specify that the love story takes place against the backdrop of the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident and that the film was first released in Hong Kong. The subject of the film is not explicitly stated to be \"Films set in China\" but rather a romantic and tragic love story between two men, which could take place in other locations as well."
