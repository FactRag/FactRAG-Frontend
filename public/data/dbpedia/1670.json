However, it does not mention him having 6 assists specifically in that season. In fact, according to one of the documents, he averaged 7.23 assists per game during March 2004. Therefore, the statement \"Chauncey Billups had 6 assists in the 2004 NBA Playoffs\" is incorrect based on the information provided."

Given his overall assist leadership and considering the nature of the playoffs which typically involve multiple games, Chauncey Billups having 6 assists is plausible and aligns with his significant contribution as a playmaker for the Detroit Pistons during the 2004 season."
