However, later in the same text, there's an anecdote about Trisha filming her show from Elstree Studios, which has led some to humorously speculate about Trisha having a \"snatch squad\" based nearby.\n\nHowever, I also found another relevant document: file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6554/re-ranker-msmarco/42.txt.\n\nIn this document, it's mentioned that The Muppet Show was produced and recorded at the ATV Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. This seems to be a serious mention of the studios, and not related to Operation Snatch. \n\nGiven these findings:\n\n* There is no clear connection between Operation Snatch and films from Elstree Studios.\n* The only indirect connection is through a humorous anecdote that doesn't imply any actual relation.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that there's insufficient evidence in the provided documents to support the triple.\n\n\n {'output': 'no'}"
