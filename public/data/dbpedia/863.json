The documents do confirm that she was born in 1854, but this is already explicitly stated in the triple itself, so it doesn't add any new information.\n\nIt's worth noting that the correct answer would be `{'output': 'yes'}` if the triple had been \"Category:1854 births includes Lillian Massey Treble\", because then we would have added information about her birth year."
