It does not mention his residence.\n* The document at file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6633/re-ranker-msmarco/45.txt mentions Haim Saban's connection to Israel, but it does not mention his residence in California specifically.\n* The documents do mention Cheryl Saban, who is an author and a resident of California (document at file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6633/re-ranker-msmarco/3.txt), but this does not imply that Haim Saban resides in California.\n\nTherefore, the information in the documents does not support the triple \"Haim Saban resides in California\".\n\nThe final answer is: \n{'output': 'no'}"
