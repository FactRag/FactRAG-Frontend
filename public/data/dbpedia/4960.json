However, none of the documents specify that he was a third-place contestant in a particular season or episode.\n\nIn fact, one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4960/re-ranker-msmarco/35.txt) mentions that Maksim Chmerkovskiy has made it to the Dancing with the Stars grand final four times in the past, ended up as runner-up twice and third place on two other occasions. This suggests that he may have had multiple third-place finishes, but does not confirm a specific instance of being a third-place contestant."
