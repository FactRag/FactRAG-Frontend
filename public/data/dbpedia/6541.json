While Roc Nation does represent some big artists and has a roster that includes Rihanna, Doja Cat, and others (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6541/re-ranker-msmarco/45.txt), this information alone is not enough to conclude that it is specifically a \"pop record label\". Therefore, the triple \"Roc Nation is a pop record label\" is not supported by the provided documents."

They mention artists like Rihanna and Alicia Keys, which are pop musicians, but also other genres like Bj\u00f6rk (who has worked in various genres) and Kacey Musgraves (country), indicating that Roc Nation operates across multiple music genres rather than being strictly defined as a \"pop\" record label."
