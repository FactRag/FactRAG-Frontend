They also describe him as a master of etching and note his ability to create stunning works of art through this technique. However, they do not state that he is an etching. Instead, they mention that he created many etchings, particularly of Rome and its ancient ruins. Therefore, the triple \"Giovanni Battista Piranesi is an Etching\" does not accurately reflect the information provided in the documents."
