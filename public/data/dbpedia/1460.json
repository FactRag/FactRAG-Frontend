McKernan, Jr., then Governor of Maine, in February 1989, but there is no information that her term started on February 24, 1989. In fact, one of the documents mentions that she was First Lady of Maine from 1989 to 1995, which suggests that her term as a U.S. Senator likely started after this date."
