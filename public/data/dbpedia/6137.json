These include:\n\n* A documentary film called \"Life On Wheels - Transportation for a new urban century\" (document 37)\n* A short fiction film called \"Love on Wheels\" (document 82), which is not explicitly mentioned as being about a type of film, but rather a love story between two young people who unite their destinies in roller skates.\n* A film called \"Werewolves on Wheels\" (document 144), which is a grindhouse motorcycles movie.\n\nThe fact that there are multiple films related to the concept of \"wheels\" or transportation suggests that \"Love on Wheels\" could be a type of film, although it's not explicitly mentioned in any of the documents."
