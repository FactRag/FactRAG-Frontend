According to the text in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2764/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt, Arthur Lakes was educated at Oxford University, where he became fascinated by one of the great early collections of fossil reptiles (including dinosaurs), and at that time, natural history was usually studied only by the independently wealthy, so Arthur studied at Queens College, Oxford."

Given the historical context and naming of the college (Queens College), it is reasonable to infer that he attended what is now known as Queen's College, Oxford, supporting the statement in the query."
