Additionally, it states that the future Thomson-East Coast Line will add another two platforms to the station, which implies that the current platforms for the North South Line and Circle Line are indeed island platforms."

Specifically, they mention that it has platforms for both the North South Line and the Circle Line, arranged in an island platform configuration. Thus, the statement that Marina Bay MRT Station has railway platforms at Island (North South & Circle Lines) is supported by the given context information."
