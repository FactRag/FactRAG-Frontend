Facts and stats about Dublin North-East (D\u00e1il constituency):\n   - It was a D\u00e1il constituency from 1937 to 1977, and again from 1981 to 2016.\n   - The electorate was 89,909, with 55,520 valid votes cast in the specified context.\n   - The turnout was 61.8%.\n   - Notable political parties represented include Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, and Labour Party among others.\n\n2. Summarize this article for a 10 year old:\n   - Dublin North-East is a place where adults choose who will represent them in their country's government. This has been happening since the 1930s and 1980s, but not always. In this area, there are lots of people who can vote (electorate) and they all choose someone to be their representative (TD). They pick from different political parties. Sometimes the same person can be a TD for a long time like Richard Bruton."
