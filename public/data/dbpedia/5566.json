The last document mentions \"Army Signal Corps photos and pictures\" which seems unrelated to Will Patton's personal photo collection.\n\nHowever, the first part of the last document doesn't seem to be about the photo collection either.\n\"... Army Signal Corps photos and pictures of himself taken by others...\"\n\nBut then:\n\"After the war, she organized the pictures as best she could into photo albums, eventually filling 11 books. If her husband had written on the back of a photo, she transcribed the caption onto the album page.\"\n\nThis part is about a collection of pictures that belong to Patton's wife, not Will Patton himself.\n\"... The collection includes six boxes of negatives and other photographs. Shown here is a sample of the collection.\"\n\nAnd finally:\n\"Kevin M. Hymel is associate editor of Army Magazine.\"\n\nWhich again doesn't relate directly to Will Patton's photo collection.\n\n**Conclusion:** While there are mentions of \"photos\" and \"picture gallery\" related to Will Patton, it seems that there is no specific information in the documents about a photo collection belonging to him.
