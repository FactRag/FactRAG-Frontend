The context does not specify whether this person was a politician or not, but the documents do mention other notable figures with the same surname. One of them is also named Alexander McGillivray and is mentioned as a \"historical figure of the Yuchi tribe in the American southeast\". However, there is no indication that this is a different person from the one born in London, Ontario. \n\nAssuming that the Alexander McGillivray mentioned in the query is the same historical figure born in London, Ontario, and not another individual with the same name, the answer would be affirmative."
