The documents only provide information about Sky Italia's business operations, ownership, and services.\n* Some documents do mention the term \"Srl\" which in Italian stands for Societ\u00e0 a Responsabilit\u00e0 Limitata (Limited Liability Company), but it is used to refer specifically to Sky Italia Srl, which is an operating company for Sky pay-television service in Italy. The context does not suggest that this specific entity is a general description of the whole company.\n* The documents do mention Comcast Corporation as the owner of Sky Group, which includes Sky Italia, but there is no indication that Sky Italia itself has a specific corporate structure such as Limited liability company.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it appears that the statement \"Sky Italia is a Limited liability company\" is not supported by the context."
