    "object": "Barthold Suermondt (18 May 1818, Utrecht - 1 March 1887, Aachen) was a German entrepreneur, banker, philanthropist, and art collector, of Dutch-Huguenot heritage.He was born in 1818 in Utrecht to Dirk Christiaan Suermondt and Elizabeth Twist. In the 1830s he worked with the Cockerill-Sambre steel manufacturers in Seraing, Belgium. He took over mamagement of the company in 1840 following the sudden death of his wife's uncle John Cockerill. Coming from French extraction, Suermondt was responsible for attracting French investment into Germany during the 1830s-40s. At that time he founded in Germany a steel company that after a number of name changes in 1870 became known as Rheinische Stahlwerks, where he served as president until 1878.His first marriage was to Amalie Elisabeth Cockerill (1815\u201359), daughter of the wealthy entrepreneur James Cockerill. The couple had six sons. He later married Nancy Suermondt Haniel (1843-1896), whose father was the mining entrepreneur Max Haniel.He was a major collector of Netherlandish and Dutch Golden Age painting, and acquired works by, amongst others, Jan van Eyck, Jan Vermeer, Frans Hals, Hans Holbein the Younger, Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Steen. In 1874 a large part of the Suermondt collection was passed to the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin, a purchase headed by Julius Meyer and art historian Wilhelm von Bode funded by a grant of \u00a350,000. The sale of his art collected came when his company experienced a rapid collapse. Another portion of his collection, amounting to 105 paintings, was bequeathed to the city of Aachen in 1882, and was instrumental in building up the display of the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum. That year Suermondt was made an honorary citizen of the city of Aachen. Around 1850, he had been portrayed in three-quarter view by Ludwig Knaus; today the work hangs in the foyer of the Suermondt-Ludwig.",
