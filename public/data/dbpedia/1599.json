However, they do not specifically state that he is about modern painters.\n* In fact, one of the documents mentions that Angel Planells' work has been \"practically unnoticed\" in the history of art, which might suggest that his style or period is not necessarily modern.\n* The other documents mention his relationship with Salvador Dal\u00ed and his participation in surrealist exhibitions, but they do not provide information about whether he is associated with the broader category of modern painters.\n\nTherefore, based on this evaluation, I would say that the triple \"Angel Planells is about modern painters\" is **no**:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
