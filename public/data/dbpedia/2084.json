While the documents do not explicitly state that this land is labeled \"United States Military Lands\", the context suggests a consistent and cohesive entity, namely the military bases and lands within the United States, which are collectively referred to as such throughout the documents. Therefore, I conclude that the triple is supported by the information provided."
