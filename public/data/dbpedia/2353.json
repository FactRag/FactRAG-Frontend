However, based on the context, I can infer that the triple might be correct.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* In document 67.txt, it is mentioned that \"Located in Belur, about 137 miles west of Bangalore in Karnataka, India\"\n* This suggests that Chennakeshava Temple is indeed located in Karnataka, India.\n* The query mentions a pushpin map caption for Chennakeshava Temple, which implies a geographical or locational context.\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that the information in the documents supports the triple:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
