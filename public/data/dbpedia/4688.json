There is no information provided about the subject matter being related to American silent feature films. In fact, one of the documents explicitly states that the film reflects many of the societal issues that affected men and women following the end of World War I."

            "reason": "The Mating Call (1928) is actually a pre-Code drama film, not an American silent feature film, as the genre of \"silent\" implies films without sound or music. However, since you already have knowledge that this film does indeed include live accompaniment and was presented in its time as a silent film with English intertitles, I would further reason: The Mating Call is actually a silent film by definition (1928), but it's not exclusively an American feature of the \"silent\" genre.",
