Guwahati is a major city in India. \n* **Urban Area:** The term \"urban area\" generally refers to a populated city or town. Since Guwahati is a city, the campus of Gauhati University is indeed located in an urban area. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other triples you'd like me to evaluate!"

Additionally, one document mentions that the university's campus includes residential quarters for teachers and staff, which implies a more suburban or campus-like environment rather than a typical urban area."
