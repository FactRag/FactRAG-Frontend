The category itself is not mentioned in the provided context information.\n\nHowever, one of the documents mentions that \"He also served as dean of the College of Pure Science and, between 1897 to 1898, as vice president and president of the American Mathematical Society.\", but this does not support the triple statement about being a subject of Category:1924 deaths. \n\nAnother document states that \"Over the course of his career, Woodward published over a 100 papers, edited a standard math textbook, and received many honors and awards.\" which mentions honours and awards, but again, does not provide information on death in 1924."
