Roosevelt was a candidate in that election. This implies that Roosevelt's candidacy occurred after the presidential election itself, not before it. Therefore, the triple is incorrect according to the provided context information."

Roosevelt assumed office (he was inaugurated as President on January 20, 1933). Therefore, the statement \"The presidential election in New York, 1936 occurred before Franklin D.
