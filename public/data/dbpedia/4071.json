They have their own distinct cultural and linguistic identity, but they are not an ethnic group separate from the Greek ethnicity. The context information provided earlier actually supports this fact, as it mentions that Greeks have sailed away to foreign lands, including Crete, and that the Cretan prefecture of Heraklion has a significant population growth during the period of 1951-1991. This suggests that Sfakians are part of the larger Greek ethnic group rather than a separate ethnic group within Greece.",
