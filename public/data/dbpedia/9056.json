In fact, one of the documents mentions that the EDM and industrial mainstay known as Delta-S has been producing music for over 20 years, but it doesn't provide any information about its origin or birthplace. The statement \"Delta-S was born\" seems to be referring to an event where they released a new EP called Coven, which is mentioned in one of the documents, but this does not imply that Delta-S itself was born on a specific date or location."
