Therefore, it can be inferred that William I was before Henry of Scotland (who is not mentioned explicitly in the documents, but is assumed to be a different individual)."

While the specific mention comparing him directly to Henry of Scotland is not present in the provided texts, it can be inferred from historical context that William the Lion reigned before other kings like Alexander II, who succeeded him.

            "full_ans": "Based on the provided context, the documents do not explicitly mention a person named \"Henry of Scotland.\" However, they do discuss the reigns and events related to William I of Scotland (William the Lion) and his interactions with King Henry II of England. The context clearly shows that William the Lion reigned from 1165 to 1214 CE, while he was captured by English knights in 1174 CE under Henry II's rule. Therefore, it can be inferred that \"William the Lion\" came before Henry II of England.\n\nGiven that there is no direct information regarding a person named \"Henry of Scotland,\" and without additional context to clarify this specific individual or to confirm the exact chronological relationship between William I of Scotland and another Henry figure in Scottish history, we cannot conclusively determine if William the Lion was directly \"before\" someone specifically called \"Henry of Scotland.\"\n\nHowever, since the query seems to compare a historical period involving William the Lion with another person named as Henry (presumably meaning Henry II of England), based on the provided documents and reasonable historical context, it's valid to say that William the Lion did precede Henry II in his reign.\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```\n\nIf the question is strictly about whether there exists a specific document or direct mention of someone called \"Henry of Scotland\" preceding William the Lion, then based on the given data:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nGiven that it's not clear what exact Henry figure in Scottish history (if any) is referred to and without further context, I lean towards providing information based on a more historical understanding rather than strictly document-based evidence. Therefore, my primary recommendation leans towards 'yes', considering the broader historical timeline.\n\nFor strict adherence to the documents alone:\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nGiven the query's likely intent in comparing reigns or periods rather than specific individuals mentioned directly:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"yes\"}\n```"
