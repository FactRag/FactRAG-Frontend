However, it also states that Ronaldinho last appeared for his country in April 2009.\n\nThis document does not provide a clear answer to whether the event occurred in March or any other month.\n\nDocument 2:\nThe text mentions that \"Brazil\u2019s match against Ireland in London on March 2\" was their last scheduled match before the South Africa World Cup opens on June 11. However, it does not provide information about when the actual event (the football match) took place.\n\nDocument 3 and 4:\nThese documents do not mention any specific dates related to Brazilian football events in 2009.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would say that there is insufficient evidence in the provided documents to confirm or deny whether the date of the 2009 Brazilian football event was March 2009.
