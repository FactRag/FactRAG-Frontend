For example:\n\n- The document mentions \"Real-time traffic monitoring and forecast\" and discusses how data from various sources like physical sensors and Floating Car Data (FCD) are used to provide current traffic conditions.\n- It also talks about \"Traffic reports\u2014Provide overall traffic statistics for the selected time range for probe tasks,\" which aligns with the concept of near real-time distribution of information.\n- The document explains that traffic data is used in a simulation approach to determine traffic flow, average speed, and density on every link of the road network. This supports the idea of providing information about road conditions like congestion.\n- Additionally, it discusses using systems such as GeoRSS for notification purposes, which can provide information to drivers near real-time.\n\nAll these points support the provided statement that traffic reporting involves distributing near-real-time information about road conditions and helps drivers anticipate and avoid traffic problems."
