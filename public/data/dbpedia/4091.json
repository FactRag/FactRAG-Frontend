The document at file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4091/re-ranker-msmarco/32.txt states that \"Nevertheless, in part due to his actions during the May 1968 crisis, he [Pompidou] appeared as the natural successor to de Gaulle. Pompidou announced his candidature for the Presidency in January 1969.\" and another document at file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4091/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt states that \"However, after being defeated in the referendum of 27 April 1969 on regionalisation and the reform of the Senate, de Gaulle resigned. Georges Pompidou, his former Prime Minister, succeeded him on 15 June 1969.\" These statements confirm that Charles de Gaulle was succeeded by Georges Pompidou."
