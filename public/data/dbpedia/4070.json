However, it is stated in several places that the Sfakians call themselves by their own name, which implies that \"Sfakians\" could indeed be used as an alternative name for them.\n\nOne specific statement mentions that Papadopetrakis presents a theory where Sfikies (the people of other districts) called the Sfakians \"sfikies\" because they would attack like wasps. However, it also mentions that Papadopetrakis dismisses this theory and suggests that the name comes from the Greek word for oleander, \"Sfakes\". \n\nAnother statement in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4070/re-ranker-msmarco/71.txt mentions that The region played a significant role in Cretan uprisings against the Venetians and the Ottomans, but does not provide information about the name \"Sfakia\".\n\nConsidering all this, it is reasonable to assume that the triple could be correct according to the documents, therefore the value should be \"yes\"."
