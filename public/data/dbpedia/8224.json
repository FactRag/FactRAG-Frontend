The document with file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8224/re-ranker-msmarco/13.txt contains information about Vital Nadziewski, which is:\n\n\"Born in Belarus, Nadziewski discovered his passion for the performing arts at a young age.\"\n\nTherefore, while it is true that Vital Valadzyankow was born in Minsk, it does not necessarily imply that he is the same person as Vital Nadziewski.
