In fact, one document mentions that Budapest is a significant location, but does not specify its relation to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. Another document simply lists Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r's location as \"central Hungary\" without mentioning any capital status. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that the current capital of the Kingdom of Hungary (assuming this term refers to modern-day Hungary) is Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r based on these documents alone."

However, it is not mentioned that the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary was Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r throughout its entire existence; Budapest eventually became the capital.
