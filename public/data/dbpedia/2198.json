The correct answer should be:\n\n{'output': 'partial'}\n\nHowever, since you asked for a binary output and considering that the provided context does not provide strong evidence against the statement being true (only partial information), I would say that the best course of action would be to mark it as \"yes\", acknowledging that the partial support is more relevant than a clear \"no\"."
