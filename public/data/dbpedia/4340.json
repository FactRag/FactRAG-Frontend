However, it does not mention anything about him being the 3rd Marquis of Villagarc\u00eda or dying at Cape Horn.\n* There is no third document that provides additional information.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I would say that the triple \"Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Villagarc\u00eda died at Cape Horn\" does not have any support from the provided documents.
