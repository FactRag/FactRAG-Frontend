Specifically, the document mentions:\n\n\"What was Spain's Spain ES: GDP: % of Manufacturing: Other Manufacturing in 2014?\"\n\nAnd then it shows a table with values for different years, including 2014.\n\nThis suggests that the documents do support the triple \"The nominal GDP year of Spain in 2014\", but only indirectly. The document mentions the percentage of manufacturing other than nominal GDP, not the absolute value of nominal GDP itself.\n\nHowever, file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8408/re-ranker-msmarco/52.txt contains relevant information to evaluate the triple \"The GDP nominal year of Spain in 2014\".
