The relevant paragraph from the document states:\n\n\"Revenues* of \u20ac 3.9 billion (-7% vs. 2022)\"\n\nThere is no mention of operating income in this paragraph or anywhere else in the provided context information. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Umicore's operating income is approximately $5,241 million based on the given information.\n\nHowever, since there is no direct evidence to support or refute this claim, and the provided context information does not contain any relevant data about Umicore's operating income, the answer should be \"yes\". This is because a \"yes\" response would imply that the statement might be true (but we can't confirm it), whereas a \"no\" response would imply that the statement is definitely false. In this case, without more information, we can only assume that Umicore's operating income could potentially be around $5,241 million.\n\nTo clarify, this answer assumes that operating income and EBIT are equivalent (EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes), but in reality, these two financial metrics might differ. However, since the question does not provide any further context or specify what type of operating income they are referring to ($5,241 million is likely a currency conversion from euros, as Umicore's revenues are given in euros), it's hard to determine whether this statement is accurate or not.\n\nIf you have any more specific details about the type of operating income or its source, I would be happy to help further!"

Instead, it mentions an adjusted EBITDA (which could be considered a proxy for operating income in some contexts) of \u20ac972 million for 2023 and \u20ac674 million as the adjusted EBIT. Neither of these figures matches the stated amount in the query. Therefore, the information does not support the triple provided."
