A 1953 film starring Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant, which is described as not being their best movie but an easy watch with great chemistry between the leads.\n2. A modern band called Dream Wife, a trio of art school students who are known for their energetic and fun performances.\n\nNowhere in the documents is it stated that the film \"Dream Wife\" (1953) or the band \"Dream Wife\" (2014-present) are about English-language films. The discussion about both entities focuses on their respective stories, casts, and styles, but not specifically on their language.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"

Therefore, the statement that \"Dream Wife is about English-language films\" cannot be confirmed based on the provided context information."
