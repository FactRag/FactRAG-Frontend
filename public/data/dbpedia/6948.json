However, they also specifically mention that Eckbach rises in a district called \"Little France\" near Carlsberg, suggesting that it may not be exclusively from Germany, but rather has a connection to this specific area within Germany. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not clear whether Eckbach is solely from Germany or has a broader origin, making the triple incorrect."
