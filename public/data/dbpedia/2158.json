The query asks if his label is indeed 'Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans'. In all the documents provided, Ferdinand Philippe's title and name are consistently referred to as \"Duke of Chartres\", \"Duke of Orleans\", or simply \"Ferdinand Philippe\" with his titles mentioned afterwards. However, one document specifically mentions him as \"Ferdinand Philippe Louis, Duke of Chartres, then Duke of Orl\u00e9ans\". Considering the multiple references across documents and the context provided, it can be inferred that 'Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans' is indeed a label associated with him."
