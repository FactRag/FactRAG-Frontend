However, it is also stated that Slovakia has been a member of the European Union for 20 years now and is more integrated into European structures than some of its Visegr\u00e1d-4 Group partners.\n\nThis information suggests that while Slovakia may have had issues with integration in the past, it no longer fits the label of being a \"black hole\" in the center of Europe. Therefore, according to the documents, the answer would be:\n\n{'output': 'no'}\n\nHowever, this is not related to the triple \"The label of Slovakia is 'Slovakia'\". In that case, the answer would indeed be yes since the country's name is indeed \"Slovakia\".\n\nSo, for the original query: The label of Slovakia is 'Slovakia'.\n\nAnswer: {'output': 'yes'}"

It emphasizes that today, Slovakia is more integrated, especially as a member of the European Union, which indirectly supports the statement that Slovakia's current label could be more positive or aligned with its current status, hence \"Slovakia\" as a label is reasonable and supported by the context provided."
