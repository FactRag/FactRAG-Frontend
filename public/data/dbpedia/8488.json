In fact, the documents suggest a more complex relationship between the two writers, with Paz interpreting and translating Pessoa's work, but also presenting him as someone whose \"work is their biography\", implying a level of admiration or fascination rather than influence."

Instead, the documents indicate that Octavio Paz wrote about and translated Fernando Pessoa's work, but there is no evidence of a direct influence from Paz to Pessoa."
