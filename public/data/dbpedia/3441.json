The first, sunk near Birchgrove Primary School by Sydney's only coal mine, was dug between 1897 and 1902 to mine coal from almost one kilometre below the Harbour floor.\"\n\nBased on this information, it can be concluded that the subject of Sydney Harbour Tunnel is indeed related to road tunnels in Australia, as it is described as a \"tunnel\" with specific characteristics (e.g., having multiple sections, being used for vehicular crossing, etc.).\n\nTherefore, my evaluation is:\n\n{ \"output\": \"yes\" }"
