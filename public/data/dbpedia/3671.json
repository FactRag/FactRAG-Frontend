One of his teams was Glentoran in the 1960s.\n\nHowever, there is also another document that mentions Trevor Thompson as a journalist and sports reporter in Australia, covering various football competitions and tournaments.\n\nSince the triple refers to a specific station (http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trevor_Thompson_(footballer,_born_1936)__6) that I don't have information about, and it seems to be related to an external resource rather than the documents provided, I'll assume that the question is asking whether Trevor Thompson's football career station is mentioned in the documents.\n\nThe answer would be \"no\", since there are multiple mentions of Trevor Thompson's work as a journalist and sports reporter in Australia, but none of them mention anything about his football career being associated with the specific station mentioned in the triple."

Instead, the documents describe Trevor Thompson as a journalist who has reported on and written about football in Australia over several decades. There is no mention of him being a football player or having a career related to a specific radio station."
