There is no mention of Capitol Records being involved in the recording or release of this album. In fact, it is stated that this was Ella Fitzgerald's only Verve complete album of Christmas tunes, and that she had another full-length Christmas album released via Capitol in 1967. Therefore, the triple \"Ella Fitzgerald's Christmas was recorded by Capitol Records\" is not supported by the information provided."
