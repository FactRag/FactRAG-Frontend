Document 1 mentions a population of 509,000 for the wider Leicester Urban Area, but it's not clear if this is the urban population specifically. Documents 2 and 3 also mention a similar population range (approximately 500,000), but again, it's not explicitly stated as the urban population. Meanwhile, Document 5 mentions an urban population of around 559,017, which is higher than the number mentioned in the other documents. Therefore, based on this information, I couldn't confirm that the population urban of Leicester is exactly 509,000."
