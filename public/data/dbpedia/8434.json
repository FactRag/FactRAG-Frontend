However, this information is from 2020.\n\nAnother document says \"The current population of Malawi is 21,728,909 as of August 18, 2024\" and also mentions a projection for 2023, which is 20.93 million.\n\nGiven the context, the statement that \"the population of Malawi is approximately 16,407,000\" might not be accurate based on more recent projections.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
