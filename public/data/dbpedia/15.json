They also mention that the Sultanate of Kedah is believed to be the oldest Islamic Sultanate in the world.\n* Documents 5-6 confirm that Sultan Al-Mudzaffar Shah I was the final King of Kedah and became the very first Sultan of Kedah after he converted to Islam.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}"
