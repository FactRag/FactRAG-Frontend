He was a master organiser.  He founded a new church (the Gereformeerde Kerken), a newspaper, the Free University of Amsterdam, and the Anti-Revolutionary Party. He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands between 1901 and 1905.  In religious affairs, he sought to adapt the Dutch Reformed Church to the challenges posed by the loss of state financial and aid, by religious pluralism, rising nationalism, and the Arminian religious revivals of his day which denied predestination. He vigorously denounced modernism in theology as a fad that would pass away.  In politics, he dominated the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) from its founding 1879 to his death in 1920. He  promoted pillarisation, the social expression of the anti-thesis in public life, whereby Protestant, Catholic and secular elements each had their own independent schools, universities and social organisations.",
