Document 1 explicitly states \"Located in Greenville, South Carolina\", document 2 mentions \"Greenville, South Carolina\" as the location of the station's virtual and UHF digital channel, document 3 does not mention a specific location but lists Greenville-Spartanburg-Asheville-Anderson market which implies that WGGS-TV is located in one of these cities, and document 4 does not mention a specific location but links to the website \"www.dovebroadcasting.com\" which also suggests that WGGS-TV is located in Greenville, South Carolina."
