According to document #2, he was born in Tonbridge, Kent, but this statement is present in a different context and does not confirm that the person being referred to is William James O'Donovan (or William O'Donovan). The other documents mention different individuals with the name William or William Joseph Donovan, but do not confirm the birthplace of William O'Donovan."
