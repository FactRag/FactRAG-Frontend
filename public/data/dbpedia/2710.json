The texts mention that Fraunces Tavern is a historic gem, a unique combination of a restaurant and museum, and a significant site in American history. They also describe the tavern's historical significance, including its role in the American Revolution and its connection to George Washington. Additionally, the documents state that Fraunces Tavern offers exhibits about the history of New York and of the building itself, which suggests that it is indeed about museums in Manhattan."
