In document 51.txt, it is mentioned that \"Ali Sokoli, a well-known Albanian pulmonologist, was born in Rahovec\" without specifying a date of birth or death. However, the other documents (10.txt, 26.txt, 49.txt) mention Mic Sokoli, who appears to be related to Ali Sokoli. The birthdate and death information for Mic Sokoli are mentioned as 1839-1881 in document 26.txt and April 1881 in document 49.txt. There is no specific date of death or date that matches September 23, 1974 for Ali Sokoli or Mic Sokoli in the provided documents."
