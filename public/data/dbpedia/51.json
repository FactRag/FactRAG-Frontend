Another mention refers to an ancestor (Nicolas Prevost) who was born around 1700 and had children with Ives Dubo.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that there are at least two different individuals with the name Nicolas Pr\u00e9vost, making it uncertain which one is being referred to when saying \"The name of Nicolas Pr\u00e9vost is Prevost, Nicolas.\"\n\nTherefore, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
