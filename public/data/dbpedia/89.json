The snow must be completely caused by a convective snow development over a lake and not by a low pressure system. The criteria for this advisory vary from area to area.Prior to the 2008-09 winter storm season, there was the Lake-Effect Snow and Blowing Snow Advisory, specific for when blowing snow another hazard expected in the advised area.",

Specifically, it mentions that:\n\n* A Lake Effect Snow Advisory is issued by the National Weather Service when pure lake effect snow may pose a hazard or be life-threatening.\n* The criteria for this advisory vary from area to area.\n\nThis suggests that lake effect snow can indeed pose a hazard or threat to life, which aligns with the statement. However, it also mentions that the criteria for issuing an advisory depend on the specific area, which might not fully support the idea of \"varying criteria depending on the area\" being a universal aspect of lake effect snow advisories.\n\nDespite this nuance, the overall information in the documents does support the statement that a National Weather Service advisory is issued when lake effect snow poses a hazard or threat to life. Therefore, my evaluation is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
