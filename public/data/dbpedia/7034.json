While both vaporwave and cyberpunk share some similarities, such as an interest in virtual reality, they are distinct concepts with different intentions and aesthetics.\n\nCyberpunk is described as speculative, forward-looking, and punk, often presenting a dystopic vision of a near future, whereas vaporwave is depicted as more nostalgic and ironic, often critiquing consumer capitalism. The information also highlights that cyberpunk's depiction of virtual reality is often juxtaposed with existentialist themes, unlike vaporwave which presents a more diegetic representation of virtual reality.\n\nTherefore, the statement that vaporwave is a subject of cyberpunk culture does not accurately reflect the provided context."
