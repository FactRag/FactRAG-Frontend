While the document from Kentucky does mention a city hall for Woodburn, it clearly states that it is located in Warren County. On the other hand, the documents from South Carolina describe a plantation house named Woodburn, which seems to be unrelated to the city hall mentioned in the Kentucky document. Therefore, the triple statement about Woodburn being a house in Charles City County, Virginia does not match any of the provided context information."
