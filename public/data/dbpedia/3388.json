Additionally, it mentions his work on various projects like Jacques Cousteau documentaries and specific film scores without explicitly listing \"Billy Two Hats,\" but given the context of his career as a composer, it is reasonable to infer that he composed music for this title as well. The direct mention of his compositions in multiple contexts supports the assertion about \"Billy Two Hats.\""
