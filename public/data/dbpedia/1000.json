While there are multiple individuals named Thomas Lane mentioned in the context information, it appears that only one of them (the one born around 1630) has a first name explicitly stated as \"Thomas\" in the text. However, another individual with the same last name (Lane), born around 1768 and living in New York, is also mentioned without specifying his first name, but he is referred to by the full name \"Thomas Lane\". Therefore, it cannot be definitively concluded that all Thomas Lanes have the given name \"Thomas\", which makes the query's answer uncertain."
