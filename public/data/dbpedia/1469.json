Therefore, I cannot determine if the triple \"The label of FC Kehlen is FC Kehlen\" is correct or not.\n\nHowever, based on the provided context, I can confirm that the following statements are true:\n\n* The document mentions \"FC Kielen\", which seems to be an alternative name for \"FC Kehlen\".\n* The document also mentions \"Football Club Kehlen\", which appears to be another way of referring to FC Kehlen.\n* There is no explicit information about the label or name of FC Kehlen in the provided context.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would say that the triple \"The label of FC Kehlen is FC Kehlen\" might not necessarily be correct because there are alternative names mentioned in the document. However, without further information, it's difficult to determine if the original name is indeed \"FC Kehlen\".\n\nTo provide a structured JSON response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
