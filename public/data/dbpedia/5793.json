Although the direct statement linking Chomsky to Adam Smith as an influence is not explicitly present in all documents, the context around them suggests an intellectual connection. Specifically, the document titled \"66.txt\" mentions that Chomsky's affinity for anarchist and socialist schools of thought does not seem to align easily with Adam Smith\u2019s work, but it also discusses how Chomsky delves into Smith's theory of the invisible hand in a video. This implies some engagement or consideration by Chomsky of Smith's ideas, which supports the influence relationship. Therefore, based on this context and the nature of intellectual influences, the answer is \"yes.\""
