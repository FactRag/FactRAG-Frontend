Additionally, while Helfrich is mentioned as being involved in homoeopathy, he is not described as a homeopathist."

The texts describe his involvement with homoeopathic remedies and his association with other homoeopathic physicians, such as Dr. Hering. This supports the description of John Helfrich as both a cleric (divine) and a practitioner in homeopathy."
