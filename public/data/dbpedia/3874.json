They mention that he commanded the II Canadian Corps and was acting commander of the First Canadian Army, leading Allied forces to victory in the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944. Additionally, they state that he was appointed Chief of the General Staff in 1951.\n\nGiven this information, it is supported by the documents that Guy Simonds was indeed a military leader who commanded significant operations during World War II, which would include Operation Infatuate (also known as the Battle of the Scheldt)."
