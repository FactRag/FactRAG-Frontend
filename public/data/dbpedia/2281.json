The specific date of December 9, 1911 is mentioned in one of the documents as his beatification date by Pope John Paul II, but not as his date of death. However, considering the context and the fact that Bernard Mary of Jesus lived from 1831 to 1911, it's likely that he died before being beatified in 1988, making December 9, 1911 a plausible date for his death."
