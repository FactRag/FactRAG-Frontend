He is described as \"rescuing Marxism from lazy dogmatism\" and integrating it with existentialist concepts like freedom and personal responsibility. \n"

In fact, the text describes Sartre's contributions to Hegelian-Marxism as substantial, but also notes that he forcefully argued against deterministic, structuralist versions of Marxism, suggesting that his philosophical approach was a synthesis of existentialism and Marxism rather than simply being Marxist."
