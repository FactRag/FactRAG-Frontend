While the documents do not explicitly state her full name in the format \"Zhang, Yueran,\" they consistently refer to her as \"Zhang Yueran.\" Given that names are often written with a space between the first and last name, it is reasonable to infer that \"Zhang, Yueran\" and \"Zhang Yueran\" refer to the same individual. Therefore, the triple stating that Zhang Yueran's name is \"Zhang, Yueran\" can be considered correct based on the context provided."
