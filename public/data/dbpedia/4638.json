In a bit of irony, the opening track \u201cStop!\u201d starts abruptly as a solid rocker throughout... The 1996 record Someday Maybe is a solid and steady effort full of steady rock/pop tracks crafted in multiple sub-genres. While neglected its due amount of promotion, this album is on par with some of the highly popular albums of the same era...\""
