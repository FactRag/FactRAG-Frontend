However, it mentions that Harry Leon Wilson, the author of \"Bunker Bean\", was an American novelist and dramatist (1867-1939). The text also mentions a play called \"His Majesty Bunker Bean\" published in 1922, which is a comedy in four acts and five scenes, and another image with the title \"BUNKER BEAN\" (no specific country mentioned), but it does not specify that Bunker Bean himself was from the United States."

This suggests that these characters, including Bunker Bean, could be from or associated with the United States, given that many American actors and playwrights were active during this period. However, the documents do not explicitly state that Bunker Bean was an American character, but based on the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that he may have been from the United States, supporting the statement in the query."
