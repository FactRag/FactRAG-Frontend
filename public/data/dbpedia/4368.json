The first few documents mention his birthplace as Heaton or Newcastle upon Tyne specifically, with one document specifying that he was born on December 18, 1938, in Heaton. Later documents also confirm his birthplace as Heaton outside of Newcastle. While the documents provide different details about Chas Chandler's life and career, they consistently indicate that he was born in or around Newcastle upon Tyne."
