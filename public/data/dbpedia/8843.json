While it can be inferred that they are likely from the United States given their presence at festivals in California (e.g., Viva PHX festival), the text does not explicitly state this fact.

For instance:\n\n- The band's album release mentions a \"Silver Lake home,\" which suggests they are based in Los Angeles, California.\n- They have performed at venues like Bar Smith and participated in events such as Viva PHX festival, indicating an American setting.\n- The description refers to \"LA life circa 2002\" for the band's sound and style.\n\nThese contextual clues strongly suggest that Moving Units are based in the United States."
