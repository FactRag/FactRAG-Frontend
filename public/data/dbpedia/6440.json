However, the statement \"The subject of Lorna Doone (1912 film) is Devon\" implies that Devon is a character or the main topic of the film, which is not supported by the provided context information. The correct interpretation is that the story takes place in Devon, but it does not mean that Devon is the subject of the film in this sense."
