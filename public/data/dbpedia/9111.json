The texts mention cowry shells as the medium of exchange in ancient China, but they specifically refer to the late Xia Dynasty (21st century BC) and the Shang Dynasty (16th century BC to 11th century BC), not the Xin dynasty. While Wang Mang, the founder of the Xin dynasty, is mentioned in relation to a monetary reform that had disastrous consequences, there is no indication that seashells were used as currency during his reign or that of the Xin dynasty."
