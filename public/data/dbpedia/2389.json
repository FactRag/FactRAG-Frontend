Based on the provided context, I can see that there are multiple mentions of Milton F. Pavlic's life and career, but none of them mention his place of burial.\n\nHowever, since the query is asking if the information in the documents supports the triple, and the answer should be \"yes\" or \"no\", I will evaluate the provided context again.\n\nUpon reviewing the documents, I can see that one of the documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2389/re-ranker-msmarco/20.txt) mentions Milton F. Pavlic as a \"United States Navy officer killed in action during World War II\", which implies that he died, but it does not provide information about his burial place.\n\nAnother document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2389/re-ranker-msmarco/14.txt) mentions that Pavlic was decommissioned in 1946 and later sold for scrapping, but it does not provide any information about his burial place either.\n\nThe provided context does not explicitly mention the phrase \"was buried at [Place of burial]\" regarding Milton F. Pavlic, so I will answer based on the absence of that specific information.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
