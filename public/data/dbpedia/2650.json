The context indicates that Stigmella inopinata was described by La\u0161t\u016fvka & La\u0161t\u016fvka, 1990 based on specimens collected by Friedrich Kasy in Armenia. Although it does not explicitly confirm its status as a moth species, given the context of Nepticulidae (a family of moths) and the detailed taxonomic descriptions, it is reasonable to infer that Stigmella inopinata is indeed a species of moth. Therefore, based on the information provided, the statement \"Stigmella inopinata is a species of moth\" can be considered correct."
