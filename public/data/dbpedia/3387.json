While they do not explicitly mention that the dialogue or language of the movie is in English, there are no statements suggesting otherwise. Given that Gregory Peck (an American actor) stars in the film and it was produced by Hollywood studios like Algonquin and Kino Lorber, it can be reasonably inferred that the language spoken in the film would be English. Therefore, the statement \"The language of Billy Two Hats is English\" is supported by the context provided, albeit not directly stated."
