They also mention that the film Offbeat (1961) provided the title for the project. In addition, they mention that the story of the second feature film \"Offbeat\" tells the story of an English literature teacher and his girlfriend, who is a choir teacher at a middle school in Oregon. This implies that the language of the film is indeed English."
