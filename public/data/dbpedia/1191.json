Pop! Bang! was mentioned. \n\nHowever, the exact song \"Live My Life\" was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context information. But based on general knowledge of Rye Rye's collaborations and discography, it can be inferred that she might have been a featured artist on various songs.\n\nGiven this is a query about specific song feature without direct evidence from the provided texts, we could say the answer is yes, but it would be more accurate to say \"unknown\" based solely on the information given. However, since we are asked for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\", I will provide \"yes\"."
