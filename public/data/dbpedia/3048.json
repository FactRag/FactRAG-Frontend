However, this birthplace might be referring to the location of the Chateau de Stuyvenberg rather than the city of Brussels.\n\nConsidering the information provided, we can conclude that the statement \"Prince Baudouin of Belgium was born in Brussels\" is partially supported by the documents, since there are two mentions of his birthplaces: one mentioning Brussels and the other mentioning a specific chateau near Brussels. However, given the context, it's reasonable to assume that the city of Brussels is implied.\n\nTherefore:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
