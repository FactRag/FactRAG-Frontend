In fact, one document mentions that Snoop Dogg and Brandy are first cousins, but there is no mention of any connection to The Gambino Family.\n\nHowever, another document does mention a connection between Boldy James and Snoop Dogg, stating that Boldy's family has always told him that they were related to Snoop. This suggests that the triple \"The Gambino Family group is associated with Snoop Dogg\" might be referring to a different type of relationship (e.g., a family connection), rather than a direct association between the two groups. If this is the case, then the answer would be:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n\nBut based on the provided context, it seems that the triple is asking about a direct association between The Gambino Family and Snoop Dogg, which is not supported by any of the documents."
