Several documents indicate that Bujumbura was indeed the capital city after Burundi gained independence in 1962 until January 2019 when it was moved to Gitega.\n\nGiven this information, the statement \"The capital of Kingdom of Burundi is Bujumbura\" does not accurately represent historical facts according to the documents. The documents do not mention a specific period where Bujumbura was the capital during the time the Kingdom of Burundi existed (if it ever did as an independent kingdom).
