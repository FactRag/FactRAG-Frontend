They also mention that Walid Muallem was a member of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, but there is no direct information about Farouk al-Sharaa's membership in the party. However, given the context and the fact that he served as foreign minister from 1984 until 2006 (the same time period during which Walid Muallem was a member), it can be inferred that Farouk al-Sharaa might have been a member of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party."

Although there is no direct mention of him being a member of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in these specific documents, his high-ranking position within the government during the era when the party was in power strongly suggests he was likely a member, which aligns with historical context and common practice for such officials."
