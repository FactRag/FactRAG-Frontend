However, this discrepancy is minor and does not affect the overall correctness of the triple.\n* \"The film stars Victor McLaglen, Sally Eilers, Barry Fitzgerald and Joseph Calleia.\" (document 57) - This statement supports the triple.\n* The mention of color in the query (\"shot in Black and White\") - The documents do not provide any information about the color of the film. Therefore, this part of the triple cannot be confirmed.\n\nGiven the above evaluation, I would say that the triple is mostly correct, but with a minor discrepancy regarding the adapter (Jerome Cady vs. Leo Birinski). However, since the question only asks for a yes or no answer, and considering that the query's statement about the color of the film is not supported by the documents, I would provide:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
