However, none of the documents explicitly state that Armenia lies southeast of a specific number (in this case, 25). The information provided suggests that Armenia's location and geography can be understood through various descriptions, but there is no direct reference to a coordinate system or a specific geographic relationship with the number 25. Therefore, based on the given context, the statement \"Armenia lies southeast of 25\" cannot be confirmed as correct according to the documents."
