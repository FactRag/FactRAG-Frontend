The minority populations are estimated to be around 2-3% (including Indigenous groups) and around 1% (Southeast Asian migrant workers). While there is a growing recognition and promotion of diversity and inclusion in Taiwan, it is not the case that about 70% of the population in Taiwan are ethnic groups."

This indicates that less than 30% of the population are from other ethnic groups, which contradicts the statement that about 70% of the population are ethnic groups other than the Han."
