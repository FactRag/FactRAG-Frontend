The document further specifies that this genre shares territory with other genres such as biopic, costume drama, heritage film, and epic film. It is mentioned that in the 1910s, the trade press contained adverts for 'historicals': large-scale melodramatic feature films based on historical stage plays.\n\nAdditionally, another document mentions \"The Victoria Cross (Vitagraph, 1912)\" as a short drama film about the Crimean War, which suggests that it is also a part of this genre. Therefore, based on the information provided in the documents, it can be inferred that the film 'The Victoria Cross' is indeed related to the historical drama films of the 1910s."

Although it's specific to one event rather than encompassing all of the decade, this does support the general claim made in the query."
