During an ASU sports broadcast, the KMVP board op missed a queue for commercials.\"\n\nThere is no mention of KMVP being classified as a B. In fact, there are various classifications and formats mentioned in the document, such as \"ADULT CONTEMPORARY\", \"ROCK & COUNTRY\", \"AOR\", etc., but none of them mention a classification of B.\n\nHowever, I can see that KMVP is actually mentioned as an ADULT CONTEMPORARY station with Beth & Bill in the morning.
