Cruz church), which suggests that Our Lady of Light Parish Church might also be an example of a church with a Baroque architectural style."

For instance, details about Quiapo Church and Sta. Cruz church in Manila describe features consistent with Baroque architecture, such as dramatic lighting and complex facades. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that a parish church like Our Lady of Light could also exhibit Baroque architectural style based on the given context."
