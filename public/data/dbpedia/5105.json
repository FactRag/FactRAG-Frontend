Later, it became WGBN-1150 AM and was described as a gospel (a form of religious broadcasting) station after being donated to the East Liberty church by Salem Communication in 1992.

It was formerly WKPA, a Top 40 formatted radio station that had aired since 1940.\"\n\nGiven this information and lack of any mention of religious broadcasting prior to its donation and format change under new ownership:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis answer reflects the historical context provided does not support the claim that WKPA's original programming was for religious broadcasting."
