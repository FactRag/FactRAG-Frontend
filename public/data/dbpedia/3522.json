While the document mentions the title 'Rich Relations', it also provides additional context and discussion about another topic, including a mention of Ruby Rich's interview. There is no clear indication that the original question being asked is related to the content of the documents provided. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot confirm or deny whether the name of the film 'Rich Relations' is indeed 'Rich Relations'."
