However, they also mention it as an extra small studio space for meetings or rehearsals (\"Studio 7 is an extra small, multi-use studio space perfect for meetings and small vocal or movement rehearsals.\") and as a beauty services studio (\"Hair & Makeup\").\n\nTherefore, based on the context information, the statement \"Studio 7 is a type of Show\" can be considered supported by the documents."
