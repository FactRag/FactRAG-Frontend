The name \"Ljanik\" appears to be associated with Marju Ljanik, an Estonian pop singer (in document 2), and also appears as part of a location name \"Ljanik garden\" in document 6. However, there is no indication that Ljanik has a length value."

There is no mention of \"Ljanik\" having a specific length in the provided context. Therefore, the statement \"Ljanik's length is 5\" cannot be supported by the given documents."
