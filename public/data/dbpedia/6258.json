The information does mention the name \"Sussex Skyhawks\" several times, but it doesn't confirm whether this is a proper noun or an entity label. If you are looking for confirmation that \"Sussex Skyhawks\" is indeed an entity label with the exact same string as its label, then the answer would be 'no'."
