The relevant information is found in multiple documents which mention that the crisis occurred in 1889. Specifically:\n\n- From `3.txt`: \"The Samoan Crisis came to a head in 1889 when all three colonial competitors sent warships into Apia harbor.\"\n- From `26.txt`: \"Samoan CrisisPart of the First Samoan Civil War Date1887\u20131889\"\n- From `35.txt`: \"THE SAMOAN CRISIS OF 1889 \u2022The Samoan Crisis in 1889 was a key event that occurred during the First Samoan Civil War and brought great changes in the political affairs and situation of Samoa.\"\n- From `75.txt`: \"For many observers, including the famed Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson who witnessed it first hand, all out war between Germany and the United States was in the offing. This then escalated as land began to be sold to Europeans and three outside countries fought to exert their powers over the islands. The First Samoan Civil War, between 1886 and 1894, was centred around whether Malietoa Laupepa or Mata'afa Iosefo should be king. The German military intervened on numerous occasions, and tensions existed between the Germans and the US, as both wanted to further interests in Samoa. When Britain entered the fray, a naval standoff between the three ensued, known as the Samoan crisis. But it was the weather that would have the final say: A tropical cyclone in 1889 destroyed six German and American ships stationed in Apia, and the three countries resolved that Laupepa was to be king.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct date for the Samoan Crisis is 1889, not 1887."
