Malcom DRUMOND.\"\n\nThis implies that Henry Berkeley Fitzhardinge Maxse was the governor of Newfoundland (or a similar jurisdiction) and had an assistant named Malcolm Drummond.\n\nLater in the text, it mentions \"We learn from the London Times of the 12th. that Lieut. Malcolm DRUMMOND, Grenadier Guards, has been appointed Aide-de-Camp to Lieut-General Sir H.F.B. MAXSE, Governor of Newfoundland\".\"\n\nThis confirms that Malcolm Drummond was an aide-de-camp to Henry Berkeley Fitzhardinge Maxse.\n\nThe text also mentions \"the new Public Wharf, now nearly finished, being used for the first time for embarkation of passengers, on this happy occasion.\" and later \"Premier Sir William WHITEWAY, Premier, arrived at St. John's from England, per 'Hibernia' on the morning of Wednesday, the 7th. inst.\"\n\nThis suggests that Henry Berkeley Fitzhardinge Maxse was governor during the time when William Whiteway (the Premier) arrived in Newfoundland.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it is correct to say that William Whiteway was governed by Henry Berkeley Fitzhardinge Maxse."
