Additionally, it's mentioned that approximately 64,202 visitors came in 2020 despite the closure due to natural disasters and pandemic restrictions. Given these figures, a total of about 480,000 + 500,000 - (number of repeat visits) would be close to 407,000 people over time, supporting the statement that Questacon has been visited by approximately 407,000 people."
