Specifically, document 47.txt and 50.txt state that Iban is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by the Iban people in Sarawak, Malaysia. Document 18.txt also mentions the Iban language as an Austronesian language predominantly spoken by the Iban people of Sarawak, and documents 48.txt and 32.txt further confirm this information."
