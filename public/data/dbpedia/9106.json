Founded in 1549...\"\n\t+ Document 2: \"Salvador was the Brazilian capital until 1763.\"\n\t+ Document 3: \"...its capital city is Salvador, which was once the Capital of Brazil.\"\n\t+ Document 4: \"Founded by the Portuguese in 1549, Salvador was the first capital of Brazil until 1763.\"\n\t+ Document 5: \"...Salvador, also known as S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos , is the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia.\"\n\nAll five documents support the statement that Salvador was a capital city of Brazil at some point in history. However, only one document (Document 2) explicitly states that Salvador was the \"Brazilian capital\" until 1763.\n\nGiven this information, I conclude that:\n\n* **Answer:** {'output': 'yes'}\n\nThe triple is correct according to the documents, but it's essential to note that Salvador was not a current or sole capital of Brazil, as stated in some documents. However, considering the original query, the answer remains \"yes\" because all documents support the fact that Salvador was indeed a capital city of Brazil at some point in history."
