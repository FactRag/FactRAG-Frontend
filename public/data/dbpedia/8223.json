In fact, the context information suggests that List of Gazprom subsidiaries is actually a list of entities and branches engaged in gas supply network operations, which includes Gazprom itself, but also numerous other companies and subsidiaries. Therefore, the relationship between Gazprom and List of Gazprom subsidiaries is more like a containment or inclusivity (Gazprom being part of the larger list), rather than a strict subsidiary-parent relationship."
