While the provided context doesn't explicitly state \"The label of A Pistol Shot is 'A Pistol Shot'\", it heavily implies this.  The documents discuss the terms \"pistol\" and \"revolver,\" focusing on distinctions in their usage and legal definitions. The repeated emphasis on these terms suggests that they are labels used to classify and identify firearms, including something potentially titled \"A Pistol Shot\".  \n\nTherefore, based on the context's focus on labeling firearms, it is reasonable to infer that the statement \"The label of A Pistol Shot is 'A Pistol Shot'\" is likely true. \n"

The definition for a pistol is given as a weapon designed to fire a projectile from one or more barrels when held in one hand, with specific requirements for chambers and stock design. A revolver is defined as a type of pistol with a breechloading chambered cylinder. This implies that revolvers are a subset of pistols, but not all pistols are revolvers."
