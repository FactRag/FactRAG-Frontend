But she added that she had not had enough powers to carry out a more radical reform.\"\n\nLater, it mentions:\n\"Appointments in law enforcement agencies must not be negotiated with politicians,\u201d she said.\"\n\nHowever, this does not provide information about Giorgi Dekanosidze.\n\nSince I couldn't find any information in the context about \"Giorgi Dekanosidze\", but rather \"Khatia Dekanoidze\", and given that the names seem to refer to the same person (the only difference being the first name), I would assume that \"Giorgi Dekanosidze\" is likely a typo or an alias for \"Khatia Dekanoidze\".\n\nIn this case, the information provided about Khatia/Dekanoidze does not mention anything related to \"Giorgi Dekanosidze_7\", so it's hard to say whether the triple is correct.\n\nHowever, based on the context that it seems like a typo or alias for the name mentioned in the text (Khatia Dekanoidze), I would provide an answer:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}"
