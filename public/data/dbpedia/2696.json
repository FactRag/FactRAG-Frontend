It seems like the relevant documents are about London's blue plaque scheme.\n\nHere's my attempt at extracting a triple:\n\nTriple: The blue plaques in the City of Westminster have the inscription 'Painter and Illustrator lived here'.\n\nTo evaluate whether this triple is supported by the documents, I'll search for mentions of the City of Westminster and its blue plaques. One of the relevant files (158.txt) contains the following text:\n```\nDo you live in Marylebone, Soho, or near Baker Street?  Living or working in central London makes it virtually impossible not to spot one of London\u2019s many eye-catching blue plaques, which mark the residences once lived in or worked in by someone who achieved something of note during their lifetime.\n\nNow the blue plaque scheme, which was first rolled out in 1866, has moved into a new phase with the release of an interactive map which allows users to locate every blue plaque in London.\n```\n\nAnd another file (46.txt) contains this text:\n```\nAll plaques carry the portcullis symbol of the organisation and anyone can propose a subject for the honour by going to the English Heritage website.  All except two of the thirty-seven boroughs of Greater London boast a blue plaque erected to a former resident.  The Borough of Westminster has the most (309) followed by Kensington and Chelsea (175) and Camden (166).\n```\n\nUnfortunately, none of these files mention an inscription 'Painter and Illustrator lived here' for the City of Westminster.\n\nHowever, upon re-reading your question, I see that this triple doesn't match any of the ones you provided as examples. You asked me to evaluate whether a specific triple was supported by the documents (like the others), but this one is different.\n\nIf you meant to ask about a different triple related to London's blue plaques, please let me know what it is!\n\nAssuming your question was just an example and not actually relevant to the provided context information, I'll answer based on a hypothetical triple that doesn't match any of the ones in the examples:\n\nAnswer:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you meant to ask about something else, please let me know!"
