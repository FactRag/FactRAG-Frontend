Additionally, there is a mention of WTCF's annual training program being established in Beijing in 2012, but it does not imply that this was when WTCF first aired. The document also mentions a specific date, October 15, 2018, when the call letters were changed to WTCF-TV from KTMM-TV, but there is no information about a specific air date for WTCF (or its predecessor).
