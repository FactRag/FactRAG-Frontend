This suggests a strong sense of community and shared identity.\n* The document also mentions that Swedish-speaking Finns live in specific regions of Finland, such as \u00c5land and along the coast (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2221/re-ranker-msmarco/66.txt). This geographic concentration implies a strong sense of community and shared identity.\n* The document states that Swedish-speaking Finns have inherited traditions from Sweden, such as the \"kr\u00e4ftskiva\" crayfish party (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2221/re-ranker-msmarco/34.txt). This shared cultural practice suggests a strong sense of community and shared identity.\n* Finally, the document mentions that Swedish-speaking Finns are a tight-knit community in Finland (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2221/re-ranker-msmarco/34.txt). This statement directly supports the triple."
