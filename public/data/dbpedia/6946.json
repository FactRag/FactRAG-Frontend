However, this does not imply any connection to Sweden.\n* Document 5 (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6946/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt) is unrelated to the Holy Roman Empire's flag.\n\nNone of these documents support the claim that the flag of the Holy Roman Empire is also the Naval Ensign of Sweden.
