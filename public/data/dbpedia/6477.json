Although not explicitly stated in all documents, several references to Nagano being on this expressway imply that the J\u014dshin-etsu Expressway passes through Saku, a location within Nagano Prefecture. Therefore, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement \"The J\u014dshin-etsu Expressway passes through Saku, Nagano\" is correct."
