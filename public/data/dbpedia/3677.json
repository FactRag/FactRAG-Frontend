Therefore, the statement \"Brewster McCloud is a film category\" can be evaluated as incorrect; it should specify that it is an instance of a film rather than a film category. However, based on the instructions to strictly answer whether the information supports the triple without additional context, and considering the triple states it is a film category which might be interpreted loosely, the response aligns with \"yes\" under the assumption that the intent was to confirm it as a film rather than categorizing it incorrectly."
