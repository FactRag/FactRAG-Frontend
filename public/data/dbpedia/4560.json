This suggests that VMM-162 does play the role of Assault Support."

For example, one document states: \"VMM-162 is the Aviation Combat Element of the 26th MEU that provides the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) six functions of aviation from assault support...\" Therefore, the triple \"VMM-162 plays the role of Assault Support\" is supported by the provided context."
