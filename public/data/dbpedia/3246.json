Instead, it appears to be a description of his performance as a soccer player.\n\nThe document also mentions \"De Ascentis\" in other contexts, such as mentioning him as a CrossFitter and describing his experiences in the sport. However, none of these passages mention anything about working at Diego De Ascentis 7.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the triple is incorrect.\n\nThe output should be:\n{'output': 'no'}"
