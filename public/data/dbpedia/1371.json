Please clarify if this assumption is correct.\n\nIf not, and you meant to ask something else, please provide more context or details about what you're trying to evaluate.\n\nAssuming the first query format (author/award relation) was intended for a different context, I'll attempt to answer:\n\nQuery: Lasse M\u00e5rtenson is depicted in http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Lasse_M\u00e5rtenson.jpg.\n\nThis seems to be asking about an image depiction. In the provided context information, there are mentions of Stefan Drechsler's work and publications, but I couldn't find any direct connection between Lasse M\u00e5rtenson and an image depiction in that specific context.\n\nHowever, within the text, I did find a mention of \"Lasse M\u00e5rtensson\" (not M\u00e5rtenson) being associated with an academic publication:\n\n \"(2017) 'Illuminated Manuscript Production in Western Iceland in the Thirteenth and Early Fourteenth Centuries', in Emily Lethbridge & R\u00f3sa \u00de\u00f3rsteinsd\u00f3ttir (eds.), Gripla XXVIII (Reykjav\u00edk: Stofnun \u00c1rna Magn\u00fassonar \u00e1 \u00cdslandi), 169\u2013196.
