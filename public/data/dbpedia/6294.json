Specifically, in the file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6294/re-ranker-msmarco/5.txt, it is mentioned that Jean Van Den Bosch won a silver medal in men's team time trial at the 1924 Summer Olympics, and also that he was part of the Belgian cycling team that won the bronze medal in men's team pursuit (4000m) along with other teammates. Therefore, it can be inferred that Jean Van Den Bosch did indeed win the bronze medal in men's team pursuit at the 1924 Summer Olympics."
