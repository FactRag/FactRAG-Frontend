However, it's not explicitly stated that WVAH-TV is affiliated with Fox Broadcasting Company. But based on the fact that WVAH-TV is a \"Fox-affiliated television station\", and considering the context of another file where Fox is mentioned as an entity in the broadcasting industry (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_415/re-ranker-msmarco/62.txt), we can reasonably assume that WVAH-TV is affiliated with Fox Broadcasting Company. \n\nNote: The correct answer might be \"no\" if the documents explicitly state that WVAH-TV is not affiliated with Fox Broadcasting Company, or if it's unclear from the context. However, based on the given information and considering the broader context of the broadcasting industry, we can assume that the triple is supported."
