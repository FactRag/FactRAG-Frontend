Given that we don't have direct evidence to confirm the triple is entirely correct as stated (the documents mention different variations and periods for individuals named Giovanni Bondioni or Giovan Maria Bondioni), but also don't explicitly contradict it in a way that would mark it as incorrect:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThis response indicates that based on the provided context, there isn't enough information to conclusively confirm or deny the triple."
