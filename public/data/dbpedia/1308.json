According to the texts, the album's genre is indeed rock music, with one text describing it as a \"thumping, guitar-driven version of new-wave rock music\". Another text mentions that the album has a feel as fresh and vigorous as any debut album, which suggests a strong focus on rock sound. The only other genre mentioned in passing is punk, but this is not the primary classification of the album's genre.\n\nThe triple \"Give the People What They Want (The Kinks song) is a Rock music\" is therefore supported by the information provided."
