He began his career in non-league with Cullompton Rangers and Elmore.\n3. He helped Yeovil to promotion into The Football League, later did so with both Hereford United and Exeter City, won the 2002 FA Trophy Final with Yeovil, and promoted into League One with Exeter.\n\nLet's examine each part:\n\n1. **Yes**: This is supported by the documents.\n\t* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8836/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt, it says \"Adam Stansfield (10 September 1978 \u2013 10 August 2010) was an English professional footballer who played as a striker.\"\n2. **Yes**: This is also supported by the documents.\n\t* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8836/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt, it says \"Having played for three counties as a child, Stansfield began his career in non-league with Cullompton Rangers and Elmore...\"\n3. **Partially yes**: This is partially supported by the documents.\n\t* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_8836/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt, it says \"He competed professionally for Yeovil Town, Hereford United and Exeter City, and won promotion from the Football Conference to The Football League with all three teams.\"\n\t* However, the specific mention of helping Yeovil to promotion into The Football League is not explicitly stated. Additionally, while Stansfield did win promotions with both Hereford United and Exeter City, there's no direct connection mentioned in the documents between these promotions.\n\t* As for winning the 2002 FA Trophy Final with Yeovil, it's mentioned that he was the top scorer with 16 goals, but not specifically that they won the final.\n\nGiven this evaluation, I would say that the triple is partially supported by the documents. The first two parts are clearly true based on the information provided, while the third part has some discrepancies and lacks specific connections.\n\nTherefore, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'partially_yes'}`\n\nNote: In a structured JSON format, I couldn't represent \"partially yes\" as a direct value like \"yes\" or \"no\". Instead, I've used this notation to convey the partial support for the triple."
