In document 34.txt, it says that \"Sremski Karlovci was the political and cultural capital of Serbian Vojvodina after the May Assembly and during the Revolution in 1848.\" This suggests that Sremski Karlovci had a significant role as the capital of Serbian Vojvodina in the past, but does not explicitly state that it is currently the capital. However, document 6.txt states that \"Sremski Karlovci is a town and municipality located in the South Ba\u010dka District of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia\", implying that Sremski Karlovci is still part of Serbian Vojvodina. Document 66.txt also mentions that \"The city belongs to the Serbian autonomous province of Vojvodina\", further supporting the idea that Sremski Karlovci is currently part of Serbian Vojvodina.\n\nConsidering these points, it can be inferred that Sremski Karlovci has a special significance as the capital or seat of Serbian Orthodox Church in Serbian Vojvodina's history and culture, and it still holds importance within the autonomous province. Therefore, the output is \"yes\"."
