While there is no direct statement about The Sounds being part of this genre, the context provided supports the broader understanding of post-punk revival as a genre that emerged during that time period and incorporates elements from post-punk. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that The Sounds could be categorized under the post-punk revival genre based on the information given."
