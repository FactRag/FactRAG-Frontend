Therefore, the answer is that the author type of Felton Covered Bridge could be considered as an Architect, but this requires some interpretation of the provided context information.\n\nHowever, a more accurate representation based on the provided context would be:\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"maybe\"\n}\n```"

However, there is no mention or implication that the bridge itself is an \"architect.\" Therefore, the statement \"The author type of Felton Covered Bridge is an Architect\" is not supported by the provided context information."
