This implies that his son Ibrahim Pasha did not bury him in Cairo (Ibrahim is mentioned as succeeding Mehemet Ali after his first severe illness), but rather it was a different person or event related to Mehemet Ali's burial. However, the query seems to be asking about Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt being buried in Cairo, which is directly supported by one of the documents mentioning \"The tomb stands as a luxuriously decorated domed building that is brightly painted with gilded green and ornamented with flowers and garlands\" (Tombs of the Royal Family of Muhammad Ali Pasha) implying that Ibrahim Pasha was indeed buried in Cairo."

The relevant information is found in `25.txt`, which describes the funeral procession and burial of Mehemet Ali (also known as Mehemet Ali or Mohamed Ali, who was an ex-Pasha of Egypt). While it specifically mentions his body being taken to Cairo for burial in a new alabaster mosque he had built, this can be reasonably inferred to include Ibrahim Pasha as part of the royal family under discussion."
