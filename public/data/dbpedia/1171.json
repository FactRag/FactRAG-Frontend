While the query specifically asks about a song or soundtrack named \"Feline Frame-Up,\" which is not directly mentioned in the provided context, there's no explicit contradiction to Carl Stalling being associated with composing music for such animations. Therefore, based on the information given and without prior knowledge, the answer leans towards \"yes\" as the statement does not contradict any of the provided documents."
