He was 44.\"\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4926/re-ranker-msmarco/21.txt states:\n\n\"Retired major league pitcher Frank Castillo died after going for a swim in Arizona's Bartlett Lake near his home Sunday afternoon. He was 44.\"\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4926/re-ranker-msmarco/10.txt states:\n\n\"Frank Castillo died on Sunday in a drowning accident while with his family at a lake near his home. Frank was a wonderful son, terrific brother, and an extraordinary father to his two beautiful girls.\"\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4926/re-ranker-msmarco/72.txt states:\n\n\"Frank Castillo\u2014who pitched for Boston from 2001-2004\u2014also passed away yesterday at age 44. Castillo perished in a drowning accident on a lake in Arizona.\"\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4926/re-ranker-msmarco/5.txt states:\n\n\"Former major league pitcher Frank Castillo, who spent parts of three seasons with the Red Sox, died Sunday in a drowning accident near his home in Arizona. He was 44.\"\n\nThe documents all agree that Frank Castillo died in a drowning accident on a lake in Arizona, and they consistently mention that he was 44 years old at the time of death. However, they do not provide a specific date for his death other than Sunday. The only document that provides a specific date is the one at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4926/re-ranker-msmarco/62.txt, which states that Frank Anthony Castillo died on July 28, 2013.\n\nSince there are multiple documents mentioning Frank Castillo's death and they all agree on the circumstances of his death (drowning accident at age 44), but some do not provide a specific date for his death, I will evaluate the triple based on the information provided in the documents. The specific date \"July 28, 2013\" is mentioned only once, in the document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4926/re-ranker-msmarco/62.txt.\n\nGiven this information, I conclude that:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
