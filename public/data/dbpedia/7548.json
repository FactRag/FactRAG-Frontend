In fact, the opposite seems to be true: the documents mention the President of the United States as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and under this command structure, the Secretary of Defense appears to have authority over both the DoD and the Department of the Air Force."

The Department of Defense encompasses multiple military branches, including the Air Force, among others."
