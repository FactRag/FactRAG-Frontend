However, since the triple only asks if he was born in Washington, D.C., this document also supports the triple.\n\n4. file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6101/re-ranker-msmarco/23.txt\n\nThis is a duplicate of the previous document and does not provide any additional information that would change the answer.\n\n5. file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6101/re-ranker-msmarco/56.txt\n\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_6101/re-ranker-msmarco/39.txt\n\nThese documents only mention Tommy Davidson's birthplace as Washington, D.C., without specifying the exact date of birth. However, they do not provide any information that contradicts the triple.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I conclude that the information in the documents supports the triple \"Tommy Davidson was born in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{'output': 'yes'}"
