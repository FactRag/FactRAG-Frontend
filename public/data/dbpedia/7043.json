This suggests that he has a connection to the United States.\n\nHowever, one document mentions \"John D. Sherwood (November 24, 1818 \u2013 April 30, 1891) was an American author\", which is a different person with the same last name.\n\nBut another document clearly states that John Darrell Sherwood is the author of books such as \"Offices in Flight Suits\" and \"Afterburner: Naval Aviators and the Vietnam War\", without mentioning any connection to another country.\n\nTherefore, based on this context information, I conclude that the triple \"John Darrell Sherwood is from the United States\" is **yes**.\n\nHere's my answer in the required format:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
