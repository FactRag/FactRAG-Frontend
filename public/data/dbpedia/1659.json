The document also provides information about other record labels that have released Horna's albums such as Woodcut Records, Solistitium Records, Moribund Records, Debemur Morti Productions/Deviant Records, and World Terror Committee.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether \"Horna's record label is End All Life Productions\" based on the given documents is:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```"
