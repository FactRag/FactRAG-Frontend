However, this is a different band from \"The Almighty\".\n* A third document mentions Pony Canyon's list of musical artists, but does not include any information about \"The Almighty\" band.\n\nBased on the provided context documents, I find that there is no explicit mention of \"The Almighty\" band being signed to Pony Canyon.
