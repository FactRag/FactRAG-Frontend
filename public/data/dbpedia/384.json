Another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_384/re-ranker-msmarco/67.txt) uses the phrase \"born into a family of builders in 1939 in Barcelona\" which also supports the fact that he was born in Barcelona.\n\nHowever, none of the documents explicitly mention his birthplace as simply \"Barcelona\", instead they mention it as \"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain\" or variations of this. Therefore, while the triple is largely supported by the context information, there is not a clear and direct statement saying Ricardo Bofill was born in Barcelona.\n\nHowever, considering the additional information provided above, I would say that the correct answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: Given that multiple documents mention his birthplace as \"Barcelona\" or variations of this, it can be inferred that Ricardo Bofill was indeed born in Barcelona."
