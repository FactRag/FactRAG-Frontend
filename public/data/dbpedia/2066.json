While this does not directly state his feast day, it is common for religious figures to have a feast day that corresponds with their death or declaration as a Servant of God, which in this case would be 9 June. Therefore, based on the information given and typical practices, the statement about Antony Thachuparambil's feast day being on June 9 can be considered correct."

            "reason": "It contradicts the information provided in section 2 of the context, which states that Antony Thachuparambil was born on December 8, 1894 and died on June 9, 1963. This suggests that his feast day would be his birthday or death anniversary, not June 9, but there is no specific date given for the feast day in the provided context. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that his feast day is likely to be his death anniversary, and since he died on June 9, it might seem like a possibility. But, considering the fact that section 4 states \"Her feast day is on 8 June.\" for Blessed Mariam Thresia who was mentioned in relation with Joseph Vithayathil, this could suggest that her feast day's date '8 June' has been kept consistent throughout and maybe it might be the same case for Antony Thachuparambil.",
