However, there is no explicit mention of film commissions or their relation to English-language films. Nevertheless, given the context and assuming some reasonable connections between the concepts, one might infer that a commission related to the Dutch film industry (Netherlands Film Commission) could be involved in facilitating or supporting English-language films as well. Therefore, the answer \"yes\" is inferred based on this contextual connection.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that without prior knowledge and explicit information about the specific context of film commissions and their involvement with English-language films, a more cautious approach would suggest providing an answer of 'no' to be conservative in affirming the correctness of the triple."
