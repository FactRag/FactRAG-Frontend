The information provided suggests his hometowns are specific locations within the United States, such as Baltimore, South Jamaica, Queens, or New Carrollton in Maryland."

Specifically, multiple sources mention Lloyd Banks as being born in New Carrollton, Maryland (a city in the United States) and raised in Queens, New York City (also within the U.S.)."

The documents mention that Lloyd Banks was born in Maryland but raised and grown in Queens, New York City, suggesting his hometown is not the entire United States but rather a specific city within it."
