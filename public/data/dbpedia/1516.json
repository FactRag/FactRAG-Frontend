The judgment states that Koch Entertainment is the exclusive distributor of Troma's mass-marketable Video Products, including DVDs, and mentions that Troma allegedly breached this exclusivity provision by directly selling 'Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead' in DVD format to wholesalers and retailers.\n\nThis suggests that Troma Entertainment was involved in distributing Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, either directly or through Koch Entertainment LP. Therefore, the triple is supported by the information in the documents."
