Turing Award recipient and cryptography pioneer Martin Hellman himself was not mentioned as Hellman's doctoral advisor but it can be inferred from the text that Elgamal had Martin Hellman as his dissertation advisor (the term \"dissertation advisor\" is not used explicitly in the documents)."

Instead, the provided context mentions that Martin Hellman's dissertation advisor was A.M. Turing Award recipient and cryptography pioneer Martin Hellman (himself), which is logically incorrect as a person cannot be their own advisor for a doctoral degree. The correct information given in the documents suggests that his dissertation advisor was not Thomas M. Cover but rather Martin Hellman himself, based on the context provided."
