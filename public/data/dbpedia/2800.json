This implies that they share the same address and possibly have some form of association. The phrase \"WAYF HD2 / 90.3 W212CG\" suggests that WAYF is broadcasting on HD2 and W212CG on the traditional FM frequency.\n\nGiven this context, I believe it's reasonable to conclude that these call signs are associated with a single station in West Palm Beach, FL. However, without explicit confirmation of a \"call\" or \"connection\" between them, we can't be entirely certain if one is calling another.\n\nTherefore:\n\nResponse: {'output': 'no'}"
