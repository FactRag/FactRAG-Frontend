However, they do mention her mother, Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy, as a daughter of King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy (see file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_969/re-ranker-msmarco/18.txt).\n\nBased on this analysis, I would say that the triple \"Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Duchess of Aosta is about Italian princesses\" is not entirely accurate. The documents do mention her connection to Italy through her mother's family, but they also highlight her marriage to a Spanish king and her own title as Duchess of Aosta.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
