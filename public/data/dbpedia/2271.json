However, this does not necessarily mean that its English name is different from what is stated in the triple.\n\nLooking at other documents, we see that there are references to a \"Military Ordinariate (Servicos de Assist\u00eancia Religiosa de Forcas Armadas) of Portugal\", which suggests that the full name of the Military Ordinariate of Portugal may indeed include \"(Servicos de Assist\u00eancia Religiosa de Forcas Armadas)\" in some contexts.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily contradict the triple statement that the \"name\" of the Military Ordinariate of Portugal is simply \"Military Ordinariate of Portugal\".\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided:\n\n**Response:**\n```json\n{'output': 'yes'}\n```\n\nThis response assumes that the term \"name\" in the triple refers to a common or widely recognized name for the institution. If the query meant to ask about the full formal name of the institution, which includes additional descriptive phrases like \"(Servicos de Assist\u00eancia Religiosa de Forcas Armadas)\", then the answer would be different."
