They also mention other museums and institutions in Manchester, such as the Science and Industry Museum, the People's History Museum, and the Portico Library.\n\nHowever, none of the documents explicitly state that the Manchester Museum is primarily about itself. The information provided suggests that the museum is a significant institution with various exhibits and collections, but it does not imply a self-referential focus.\n\nTherefore, based on the available context, the triple \"The Manchester Museum is primarily about Manchester Museum\" appears to be supported by the documents."
