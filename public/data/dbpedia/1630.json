However, given the context, it can be inferred that the manufacturer is likely to be Team Lotus since the information mentions \"Lotus\" as the entity associated with the design and use of the car. Nonetheless, the claim could still be considered wrong because it assumes a level of specificity (i.e., that Team Lotus was the sole manufacturer) without actually stating it.",
