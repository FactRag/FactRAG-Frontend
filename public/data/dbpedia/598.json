However, there are several mentions of J\u00f3zef Unrug being associated with naval defence, including his position as commander-in-chief of the Polish Navy during World War II. Although the Battle of Gdynia is mentioned, it does not specifically state that J\u00f3zef Unrug was its commander. However, it is stated that he led the Polish maritime defense in general. The key phrase \"led the Polish maritime defense\" can be interpreted as suggesting that Unrug could have been involved in the broader naval defence effort, which may include the Battle of Gdynia.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information and without prior knowledge, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement about J\u00f3zef Unrug being the commander of the Battle of Gdynia might be supported."

For instance, document `3.txt` states, \"The 'Battle of Gdynia' was one of the larger battles in northern Poland during Germany\u2019s 'Weiss' invasion of Poland (8/14 September 1939).\" Additionally, it mentions, \"The forces defending Gdynia were grouped under the Land Coastal Defence, commanded by Pu\u0142kownik Stanis\u0142aw D\u0105bek and the Naval Coastal Defence, commanded by Komandor Stanis\u0142aw Frankowski.\" Although this does not directly name J\u00f3zef Unrug as the commander of the Battle of Gdynia, the historical context provided in `60.txt` and other documents supports that he held significant command roles related to naval operations during World War II. Given the time frame and his rank, it is reasonable to infer his involvement or command in such an important battle."
