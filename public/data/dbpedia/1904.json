However, it mentions that she is an American soprano from Los Angeles, California, which implies that she is likely to be from California, but this is not explicitly stated as her category.\n* On the other hand, the documents do state that Angel Blue is an American classical and opera singer who hails from Los Angeles, California. This provides strong evidence that she is indeed a singer from California.\n\nTherefore, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
