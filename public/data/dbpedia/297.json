The specific event \"Against All Odds\" is not mentioned as a follow-up event in any of the documents provided.\n\nHowever, TNA Against All Odds (2009) is indeed an event that took place on February 8, 2009, which is after January 11, 2009 when TNA Genesis 2009 occurred. \n\nBut, there's no information in the given context about the fact that \"TNA Genesis (2009)\" is directly followed by \"Against All Odds (2009)\"."
