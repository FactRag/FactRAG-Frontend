They also mention that Matthew Marvin (second) was born in England about 1627 and was then eight years of age when he arrived in New England with his father. This suggests that Matthew Marvin (second) would have been born around the same time period as John Marvin, who is mentioned later in the documents. However, there is no direct information in the documents to confirm or deny whether John Marvin was born in Connecticut Colony. Nevertheless, based on the context and the fact that John Marvin's activities are taking place in Hartford and Norwalk, which were both settled by Matthew Marvins, it can be inferred that John Marvin would have been living in the Connecticut Colony at some point in his life. Therefore, the answer to this query is affirmative, but with a degree of uncertainty due to the lack of direct information about John Marvin's birthplace."

Given the context and timing, it is reasonable to infer that John Marvin, or at least his family line, was born in what would later be known as the Connecticut Colony."
