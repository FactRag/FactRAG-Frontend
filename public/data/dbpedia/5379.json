The document related to Arnon Milchan (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5379/re-ranker-msmarco/102.txt) lists him as a producer, but another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_5379/re-ranker-msmarco/33.txt) also mentions Barbra Streisand as a co-producer. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Arnon Milchan is the producer of \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" without considering both sources."
