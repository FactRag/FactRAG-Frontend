However, it does not explicitly mention the format of WTYS AM. But, we can infer that WTYS AM shares some similarities with WTYS FM as they both have similar formats and are associated with each other.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3951/re-ranker-msmarco/44.txt, it is mentioned that Nashville stars have a horde of paid helpers -- from backing band members and songwriters to stylists -- at their beck and call.  Cochran has one main musical assistant. This does not directly support the statement about WTYS AM's format.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I would say:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
