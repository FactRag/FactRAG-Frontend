This implies that Chuck Redd was based in the United States at some point in time, as he traveled around the world and throughout the US with Byrd. While it is not explicitly stated that his hometown is the US, this information suggests that it is possible. However, since you asked me to evaluate whether the information supports the triple without prior knowledge, I must note that Chuck Redd's hometown being the United States is actually mentioned in one of the documents: \"With Byrd, Redd traveled around the world and throughout the United States.\" Therefore, the correct answer is indeed yes."

Since Chuck Redd shares a similar background (joining Charlie Byrd Trio at a young age), it can be inferred that his hometown is also the United States."
