In fact, document 44.txt mentions that CSN has stations and translators across the United States, including Alaska and the Hawaiian islands, which suggests a broader geographical presence than just Texas.\n\nDocument 23.txt does mention \"nationwide\" translators for CSN International, but it doesn't specify any particular location like Bushland, Texas. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the documents, the triple is incorrect."

They discuss the locations of some of CSN International's operations and translators across various states such as California, Idaho, Nevada, etc., but specifically identifying Bushland, Texas is not supported by the given context."
