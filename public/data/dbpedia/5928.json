In fact, the information indicates that Michael Portillo served as the Leader of the Opposition (1994-1996) and then as Prime Minister from 1995 to 2005, while Michael Howard took over as leader after Portillo resigned or was defeated in the leadership contest. There is no direct evidence provided that suggests Michael Portillo was Howard's predecessor as Prime Minister."
