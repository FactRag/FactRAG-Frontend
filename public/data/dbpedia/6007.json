In fact, one document mentions a population density of 101.5 people per square kilometer (264 per square mile), and another document mentions a population density of 265 per sq mi/ 102 people per km\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the information in the documents does not support the triple, so:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
