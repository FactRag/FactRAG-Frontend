Additionally, there are mentions of gold dinars being used in the Mali Empire, but salt is also explicitly mentioned as a currency or means of exchange, alongside gold dust, cowries, Maria Theresa thalers, and other commodities. The documents also discuss the importance of salt trade in the empire's economy, with prices quoted for salt transactions (e.g., \"At Iwalatan a load of salt brings eight to ten mithqals...\")."
