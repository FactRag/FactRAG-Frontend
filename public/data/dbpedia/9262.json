The text from file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9262/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt mentions that \"In 1648, M\u00fcnster (and its neighbouring city Osnabr\u00fcck) was the site of the Peace of Westphalia. This effectively ended the Thirty Years\u2019 War and resulted in state sovereignty for the Netherlands and Switzerland.\" Additionally, file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9262/re-ranker-msmarco/75.txt states that \"M\u00fcnster passed to Prussia in 1816 and became the capital of the province of Westphalia\". The text from file_path /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9262/re-ranker-msmarco/42.txt also confirms this, saying that \"M\u00fcnster was the capital of the province.\" Therefore, the statement \"The capital of Province of Westphalia is M\u00fcnster\" is supported by the documents."
