According to the text, Inseminoid is actually a Category:1980s science fiction horror films film directed by Norman J. Warren, and it has been criticized as an imitation of Alien, which was released in 1979 (a Category:1970s science fiction horror films film). There is no connection between Inseminoid and Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela or any of the other subjects."
