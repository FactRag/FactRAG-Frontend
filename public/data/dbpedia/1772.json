(file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1772/re-ranker-msmarco/57.txt)\n* He is mentioned to have published a calendar in Turkish and Kurdish with Attorney Nesip Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, implying that he is an attorney. (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1772/re-ranker-msmarco/72.txt)\n* A biography of Sezgin Tanr\u0131kulu is provided, stating that he is the leading human rights attorney in Turkish Kurdistan and co-founder of the Diyarbakir Human Rights Association. (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1772/re-ranker-msmarco/10.txt)\n\nThese points suggest that Sezgin Tanr\u0131kulu is indeed a lawyer, supporting the triple statement."
