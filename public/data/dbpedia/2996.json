Furthermore, it is stated that  \"In a last section I will try to shed a little light upon what I consider the most important element of the philosophy of argument. Argumentation is not only instrumental but requires a specific attitude and education in the personality of the arguer: It is the firm conviction that one\u2019s subjective certainties (i.e. prejudices, vested interests and even the contemporary knowledge) have to be subordinated under the aim of truly understanding and shaping the human world.\"  This suggests that Wohlrapp's work centers around the idea of argumentation as a process deeply connected with philosophical dialectics."
