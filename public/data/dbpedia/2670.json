However, by the time of the most recent document (2019), it appears that the NOC (which includes BODC) has moved its operations to independent & charitable status, but still references being located in Liverpool. Therefore, the statement \"The British Oceanographic Data Centre is located in Liverpool\" can be considered supported by the documents."
