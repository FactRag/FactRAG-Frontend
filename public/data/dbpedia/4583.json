According to one of the documents (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4583/re-ranker-msmarco/4.txt), he was actually born in Amherst, Nova Scotia in 1821, but his father was a minister and it is not explicitly stated that Charles Hibbert Tupper himself was born there.\n\nHowever, according to another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4583/re-ranker-msmarco/34.txt), Sir Charles Tupper, the father of Charles Hibbert Tupper, was indeed a minister and had his roots in Amherst, Nova Scotia.\n\nHowever, Charles Hibbert Tupper's birthplace is mentioned as Halifax, Nova Scotia (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4583/re-ranker-msmarco/10.txt).\n\nSo, considering the provided context information, I would say:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThis is because Charles Hibbert Tupper was not explicitly stated to be born in Amherst, Nova Scotia. His father's birthplace and connection to Amherst are mentioned, but it is his mother who gave birth to him in Halifax."
