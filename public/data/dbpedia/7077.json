However, the query asks if \"Haunted Island\" (specifically named) is located in the United States, which is not directly supported by the documents since no single island or place called simply \"Haunted Island\" is mentioned.\n\nThe information given includes Alcatraz Island, United States and St. Helena Island, United States as haunted islands but does not provide details about a singular unnamed entity called \"Haunted Island\". Therefore, while there are haunted islands located in the United States according to the provided context, we cannot confirm that the specific named island of \"Haunted Island\" exists based on this information.\n\nThe answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis is because the query asks about a specific entity which isn't directly addressed or confirmed by the text."
