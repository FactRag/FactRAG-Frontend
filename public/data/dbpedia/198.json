The Athenians suffered very heavily casualties during this battle, with 430 men and all of the generals killed.\"\n* Another document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_198/re-ranker-msmarco/1.txt mentions that \"They destroyed the crops outside the city and began negotiating with pro-Athenian factions in Chalcidice, but the anti-Athenian factions asked for help from Olynthus.  An army from Chalcidice, Spartolos, and Olynthus met the Athenians in battle, but their hoplites were defeated and they retreated to Spartolos; their cavalry and peltasts (light infantry armed with javelins), however, gained the advantage over the Athenian troops.\" However, it does not mention casualties specifically.\n* The other documents provide additional context about the Battle of Spartolos, but do not directly contradict or support the statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
