In some cases, it refers to a diocese or a geographic region, while in others, it's used as an ethnonym to refer to the inhabitants of Cumania. However, in none of these contexts is \"Cumania\" explicitly mentioned as being synonymous with \"Cumans\".\n\nGiven this information, I would conclude that the statement \"The common name of Cumania is Cumania\" might be misleading or inaccurate. The Cumans were a nomadic confederacy, and the term \"Cumania\" primarily referred to a political entity or geographic region, rather than being a direct synonym for the ethnonym.\n\nTherefore, my response would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates that the statement is not supported by the documents."
