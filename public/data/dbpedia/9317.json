The Dinar became worthless between 1992 and 1994. This suggests that the currency of Republic of Montenegro was actually the Yugoslav Dinar during this time, not the Euro.\n\nIt's worth noting that the text does mention that Montenegro adopted the Euro in 2002, but it does not imply that the Euro was used as currency between 1992 and 2006."

The document mentions that prior to joining the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (and later using the Yugoslav Dinar), Montenegro had its own currency systems. Therefore, the statement \"The currency of Republic of Montenegro (1992-2006) is Euro\" is incorrect based on the given information."
