However, in none of the documents is the full name \"McColm, Matt\" mentioned together. The order and capitalization may vary (e.g., \"Matt McColm\", \"McColm was born on January 31, 1965. He is an actor, known for The Matrix Reloaded (2003), They Live (1988) and R.I.P.D.  (2013). - in this case, \"Matt\" comes before \"McColm\"), but the first name is always \"Matt\".
