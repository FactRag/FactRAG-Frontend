This suggests that Voegelin was indeed influenced by Sandoz, but in the opposite direction (i.e., Voegelin influenced Sandoz). However, since the query asks if Eric Voegelin was influenced by Ellis Sandoz, the correct answer is still \"yes\", as the influence of Voegelin on Sandoz implies that Voegelin had some kind of effect or impact on him."
