The only mention of a production studio is Amblin Entertainment, but it does not specify that they produced the 1991 version. Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no evidence to support or deny the claim that Cappa Films produced the 1991 film \"Cape Fear\", and hence the response is 'no'."
