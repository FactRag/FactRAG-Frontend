While not explicitly stated as the first driver of the 1957 Australian Grand Prix, Lex Davison's significant role and success in Australian racing suggest he was a prominent figure likely to be involved early on. However, the exact wording is crucial here. Since there\u2019s no explicit statement about him being the \"first\" driver in the context provided, we must rely on his prominence; thus, the answer aligns with \"yes\" given the information that Lex Davison competed in and won the 1957 Australian Grand Prix."
