The abstract only states that with a length of 1.6 kilometers (and 2.5 kilometers including the highway), it is the 9th longest bridge in Russia, without specifying the year.\n\nGiven this evaluation, I would say that the information in the documents partially supports the triple, but not entirely. However, since you asked me to provide a structured JSON format with either \"yes\" or \"no\", and considering that the abstract does mention some of the characteristics mentioned in the triple (although it doesn't fully confirm the specific ranking), I would still say:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nBut keep in mind that this is a slightly nuanced interpretation, as the information in the documents doesn't fully confirm the specific statement made in the triple."
