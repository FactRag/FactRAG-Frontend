However, if by \"label\" in this context it was meant to refer to a record label rather than her name, then the answer would be based on whether any documents mention Patti LaBelle as being signed to a specific record label, which they do not. Given the query's phrasing and without additional context, the answer is structured assuming \"label\" refers to her name or professional identity."
