However, none of the documents explicitly state that Valis II is about the \"Valis series\" category.\n\nThe relevant information in the documents includes:\n\n* The game Valis II is described as being part of a larger franchise called the \"Valis video game series\".\n* A list of games in the Valis series is provided, with Valis II listed as one of them.\n* The text mentions that Valis II was developed and released by Telenet Japan originally for TurboGrafx-CD.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that while Valis II is indeed part of the \"Valis video game series\", there's no clear indication that the document is about the broader \"Valis series\" category. The documents seem to focus more on providing specific details about Valis II as a game rather than discussing the larger franchise.\n\nTherefore, considering the context information provided and without prior knowledge, I would conclude that:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
