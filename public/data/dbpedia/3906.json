Through his films he became a powerful spokesperson for the growing environmental awareness in Canada, and indeed the world. His two documentary feature films, Cry of the Wild and Waterwalker, are among the most successful feature length films ever made in Canada.\" Given that \"Cry of the Wild\" is attributed to Bill Mason in these documents, it logically follows that he is also the writer or creator of the film \"Death of a Legend,\" as both are his documentary works mentioned."
