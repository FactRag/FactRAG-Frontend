The documents provide strong evidence to support this claim, and it seems accurate to categorize Suermondt as an entrepreneur based on the information provided.\n\nHere's my response in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"

For instance, one document states, \"An energetic mastermind in Germany\u2019s emerging coal and steel industry, a cosmopolitan banker and a multilingual alderman \u2013 Barthold Suermondt (1818 \u2013 1887) was one of the most important industrialists during the so-called \u201cfounder years\u201d in the Aachen-Li\u00e8ge region.\" This information clearly supports the classification of Barthold Suermondt as an entrepreneur."
