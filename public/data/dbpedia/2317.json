In fact, document 4 mentions that McAuley Catholic High School has a specific focus on education (catering for students aged 11-18), but this does not necessarily imply that it is representative of the broader topic of \"Education in Joplin, Missouri\". Additionally, document 1 explicitly states that McAuley Catholic High School is a private high school with an enrollment of approximately 70 students."
