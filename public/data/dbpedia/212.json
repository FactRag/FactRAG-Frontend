In fact, one document describes them as a \"southern hard blues-rock\" band and another mentions they play in a \"blues-infused rock and roll\" style, which suggests a more structured or traditional rock sound rather than a jam band's typical improvisational nature.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, I conclude that the statement \"The Black Crowes is a jam band\" is not supported by the documents."
