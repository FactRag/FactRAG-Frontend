While the specific parent organization is not explicitly mentioned, it is repeatedly stated that RATP Group is a French state-owned enterprise (EPIC) or a state-owned public transport operator headquartered in Paris, France. This implies that the Government of France has some level of ownership or control over the RATP Group, supporting the assertion that its parent organization is the Government of France."
