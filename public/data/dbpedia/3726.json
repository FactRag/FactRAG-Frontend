But, I did find some indirect information:\n\n* In the file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3726/re-ranker-msmarco/8.txt, it mentions that Almere City has progressed to the next round of the Eerste Divisie promotion play-offs. This implies that they have played in the Eerste Divisie before.\n* In the file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_3726/re-ranker-msmarco/73.txt, it mentions that Almere City FC has played 13 consecutive seasons in the Eredivisie. This does not provide direct information about a season in the Eerste Divisie, but it suggests that they have played in multiple leagues.\n\nConsidering this indirect information and the fact that there is no explicit statement about Almere City FC playing in the Eerste Divisie during 2014-15, I would still say that the answer could be \"no\" or \"yes\" depending on how one interprets the available information. However, for the sake of providing a clear answer in the requested format:\n\n\n{ 'output': 'maybe' }"
