The term \"Taifa\" is also defined as a small Islamic kingdom, which formed after the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba descended into civil war in the 11th century, and Algeciras is mentioned as one of the towns that was part of this principality.\n\nTherefore, according to the information provided, it can be inferred that the capital of Taifa of Algeciras was indeed located in Andalusia."

However, there is no information provided about a capital city named Andalusia in relation to the Taifa of Algeciras. Moreover, Andalusia is not described as a capital but rather as the region where Algeciras is located. Therefore, the statement that the capital of the Taifa of Algeciras is Andalusia is incorrect based on the given context."
