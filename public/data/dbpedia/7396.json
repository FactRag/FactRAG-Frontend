One of the documents mentions that a Nazam must have specific characteristics, but it does not explicitly mention Ghazal as one of them. However, another document explains the structure of an Urdu Nazam by Noshi Gilani, which includes couplets and paragraphs with a rhyming pattern different from Ghazals. Since Ghazal is mentioned as a separate genre in one of the documents, but not specifically associated with Noshi Gilani's style, this triple can be evaluated to \"yes\" because Noshi Gilani's poetry has characteristics that are distinct from those of a Ghazal."
