The plot revolves around comedic deception and romance, suggesting it is based on a play as stated in the query. \n"

This supports the play aspect but hints at modifications by the filmmakers.\n- The documents list Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith as stars of the film, which matches the statement.\n- It also mentions K\u00e1roly Makk as the director, supporting this part of the statement.\n- While the term \"comedic deception\" isn't explicitly mentioned, elements like the husband disguising himself as another character for an audition fit within a comedic framework, and thus can be inferred to support the statement\u2019s description."
