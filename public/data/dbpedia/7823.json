In fact, it seems to be the other way around: Wilamowitz-Moellendorff dedicated one of his works to Usener (Antigonos von Karystos, 1881), and Usener tried to have Wilamowitz-Moellendorff appointed in Bonn (in 1880 and 1890)."

Instead, the texts indicate that they had a significant academic and personal relationship, with Usener being influential in Wilamowitz's career and even attempting to have him appointed at Bonn University, but there is no mention of an advisory relationship between them."

As Usener presided, he took the opportunity to invite Wilamowitz for one of the main lectures\u2014a great honor for the young professor of Greifswald. The lecture was so badly received that Wilamowitz did not return to the conventions until 1921, but during the meeting Usener and Wilamowitz began a friendship that, with vicissitudes, survived until Usener\u2019s death.\"\n\nGiven this context, it does not definitively state or imply that Hermann Usener was Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff's advisor in an academic sense.
