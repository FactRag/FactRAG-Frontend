There's no mention of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in this document either.\n\nHowever, according to document `file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4216/re-ranker-msmarco/31.txt`, the Canadian production and distribution company DHX Media purchased the Ragdoll programme catalogue in 2013. But there's no direct connection between this event and The Adventures of Abney & Teal being distributed by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nSince none of these documents directly support or confirm that The Adventures of Abney & Teal was distributed by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, I would evaluate the triple as incorrect.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
