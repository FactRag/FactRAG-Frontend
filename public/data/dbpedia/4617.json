However, one document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4617/re-ranker-msmarco/171.txt) mentions a \"boy\" who allegedly killed someone, and another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4617/re-ranker-msmarco/48.txt) refers to \"the teen\" involved in the shooting.
