The text also states that it is an American drama film. However, later on, the documents mention that Wayne Blair is an Australian director, which suggests that while the film is about Iran's class struggles and the Iranian Revolution, it might not be exclusively about \"American\" films.\n\nGiven this context, I would say that the triple is **incorrect**, as the film appears to be more closely related to Iranian or Middle Eastern themes rather than being strictly about American films. Therefore:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
