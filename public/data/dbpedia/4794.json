Additionally, the exact date and amount of the acquisition are mentioned in multiple documents, but they slightly differ ($19.6 million instead of $21.7 million). Therefore, the statement \"which was acquired by Symantec on February 13, 2003\" is incorrect based on the provided information."

However, the exact date of February 13, 2003, for the acquisition is not explicitly mentioned in the given documents; the closest date provided is \"Feb. 14\" (in document 11.txt), which might be a minor discrepancy that does not invalidate the overall statement about the acquisition."
