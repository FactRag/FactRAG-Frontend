However, there are no mentions of him being convicted of any other type of fraud (e.g., financial, securities, etc.).\n\nHowever, the statement \"Dale Brown is a subject of the category American people convicted of fraud\" seems to be too broad and incorrect, as it implies that he has been convicted of multiple types of fraud. The correct statement should be more specific and limited to tax fraud.\n\nSo, my evaluation is:\n{'output': 'no'}\n\nNote: This means that while Dale Brown was indeed convicted of tax fraud, the statement in question seems to imply a broader scope of conviction that is not supported by the documents."
