This implies that Konin County is a subdivision of the Pozna\u0144 Voivodship, Kalisz Voivodship, Sieradz Voivodeship, \u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship, Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Voivodeship or Inowroc\u0142aw Voivodeship. \n\nHowever, file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_158/re-ranker-msmarco/7.txt also mentions that Konin County is a subdivision of Kalisz Voivodship from 1452 until 1716 and again after 1793. Later, it was occupied by Prussia but during the Ko\u015bciuszko insurrection in 1794 it was temporarily liberated by the insurgents. In the years 1807-1815 it belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw and later to Congress Poland. This implies that Konin County is a subdivision of Kalisz Voivodship. \n\nTherefore, it is more correct to say that D\u0119bicz, Konin County is a subdivision of Konin County is not entirely accurate and instead should be stated as \"D\u0119bicz, Konin County is a subdivision of Kalisz Voivodship\". However, this was not an option given in the query so the closest answer would still be 'yes'."

Specifically, \"Konin County\" (Powiat koni\u0144ski) is mentioned as part of the administrative division structure within Greater Poland Voivodeship. The document also mentions D\u0119bicz as a place located within Konin County, further supporting that D\u0119bicz, Konin County could be considered a subdivision or part of Konin County."
