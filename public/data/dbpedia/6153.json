Although the context does not explicitly state that Spencer Kimball is a computer programmer, his role as one of the founders of an image editing software strongly supports this claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the triple \"GIMP was written by Spencer Kimball (computer programmer)\" can be considered correct."
