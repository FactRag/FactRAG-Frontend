While not explicitly stated that \"Dirham\" was the currency used during this time, it is a reasonable inference based on historical context that the Dirham was indeed the currency used in Islamic taifas during this period. However, since the documents do not explicitly state this fact, we are evaluating the information given and making an educated guess based on typical knowledge about Islamic monetary systems of that era. Given the query's statement aligns with general historical understanding, we respond affirmatively."
