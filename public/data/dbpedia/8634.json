Since we have no information about this file, I will assume it might be true or false.\nHowever the document 26.txt shows \"It has been listed at Grade II* by English Heritage in view of its architectural importance.\" This suggest there is not a link to web page and therefore I will answer \"no\" as the document do not contain explicit information about the web page, but it do not exclude that this information might be present in another file.\n\nSo the final response is: {'output': 'no'}"
