However, one of the documents mentions that Cidade Negra is \"one of Brazil\u2019s most popular reggae groups\" (see document with file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1134/re-ranker-msmarco/8.txt), which implies that the band originated in Brazil. Additionally, another document mentions that the band has been making music for more than 30 years (see document with file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_1134/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt), which also suggests that the band was established in Brazil around the 1980s.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would conclude that the triple is partially supported by the documents. The correct answer would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
