However, there is no mention of Hideki Yukawa being a teacher or mentor to Yoshio Nishina.\n* The documents do mention that Hideki Yukawa was one of Tomonaga's classmates during undergraduate school, but this does not imply any direct relationship between Yukawa and Nishina."

In fact, the information states that Nishina became a leading figure in quantum physics after his return to Japan and mentored generations of physicists, including two Nobel Laureates: Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. This implies a mentor-student relationship from Yukawa to Nishina, not the other way around as stated in the query."
