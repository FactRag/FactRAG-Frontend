While the articles mention that GoldenSource was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in New York City, they do not explicitly state that GoldenSource is subject to Category:Software companies based in New York.\n\nHowever, the context information does provide some clues:\n\n* Article 39.txt mentions that GoldenSource provides software to investment banks, asset managers, and capital markets services firms.\n* Article 90.txt mentions that GoldenSource provides software that enables many of the world's largest and most prominent investment banks, asset managers, and capital markets services firms to manage and derive insights from their data in a more streamlined manner.\n* The other articles mention various aspects of GoldenSource's business, but none of them explicitly state its subject category.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to assume that GoldenSource could be categorized as a software company based in New York. However, without explicit confirmation from the context information, we cannot be 100% sure.\n\nTherefore, I would say:\n\n**Response:** {'output': 'maybe'}\n\nIf you'd like me to change it to yes or no, please let me know!"
