However, it can be inferred from the text that he was a Seattle civic and business leader, which suggests that the hospital might be located in the United States. However, this inference alone is not strong enough to confirm that he died in the United States.\n\nUpon closer inspection of the documents, we find a mention of \"the United States and Canada\" as places where Emil George Sick had business interests (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2853/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt). This information does not directly confirm that he died in the United States, but rather highlights his connections to both countries.\n\nAnother document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_2853/re-ranker-msmarco/44.txt) mentions that Emil George Sick was a brewing worker and industrialist in Canada and later the U.S., but again, this does not directly confirm his place of death.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it cannot be definitively confirmed that Emil Sick died in the United States. \n\nNote: The other triple you asked about is not related to the provided context and seems to be unrelated to the conversation started by your question."

Additionally, he passed away on November 10, 1964, in Swedish Hospital, which is located in Seattle, Washington, United States. Therefore, the statement \"Emil Sick died in the United States\" is supported by the documents provided."
