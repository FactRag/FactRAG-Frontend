However, this does not mention Moby Grape.\n* In file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4078/re-ranker-msmarco/69.txt, it is mentioned that Peter Lewis of Moby Grape was part of the soundcheck for The Electric Prunes at the Baypop Festival in San Francisco in 2002. **This provides direct evidence that Peter Lewis, a member of Moby Grape, was associated with The Electric Prunes**.\n\nBased on this evaluation, I conclude that:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`\n\nMoby Grape is indeed associated with The Electric Prunes, as evidenced by the mention of Peter Lewis's involvement with The Electric Prunes."
