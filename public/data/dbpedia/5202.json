However, since the question is asking for a structured JSON format answer and given that the document does not contain any relevant information to support this triple, I will provide a \"no\" answer.\n\n**Triple 2: Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela award Nobel Prize in Literature**\nThe context information mentions that \"the novel Secuestro y fonda de Cela en Contamina by Jos\u00e9 de Cora, is set in the pueblo and recounts a fictional history of the kidnapping of 1989 Nobel Prize winner Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela\". However, it does not mention that Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela won the Nobel Prize in Literature. We can only confirm that he was a 1989 Nobel Prize winner, but without knowing the category (Literature or not), we cannot be certain if this triple is correct. Given the ambiguity and without prior knowledge, I will provide a \"no\" answer.\n\n**Triple 3: Los Pintanos is in UTC offset +1.**\nThis triple does not seem to match any information provided in the context files. The document mentions locations like Alhama de Arag\u00f3n, Contamina, Monasterio de Piedra, and others, but it does not contain any information related to \"Los Pintanos\". Therefore, I will provide a \"no\" answer.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\n* Pat Frank author Alas, Babylon: {'output': 'no'}\n* Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela award Nobel Prize in Literature: {'output': 'no'}\n* Los Pintanos is in UTC offset +1: {'output': 'no'}"
