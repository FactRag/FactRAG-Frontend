Specifically, in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_950/re-ranker-msmarco/53.txt, it is mentioned that \"Robert 'Leo' Kieffer, 86, passed away August 12, 2017, in Bangor surrounded by his family.\" This suggests that the given name of Leo Kieffer is indeed \"R. Leo\" or simply \"Leo\", as it appears in multiple documents with slight variations (e.g., \"Robert 'Leo'\", \"Robert Leo\")."
