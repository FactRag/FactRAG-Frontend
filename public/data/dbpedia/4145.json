Cupp was shot-down over the Solomon Islands in 1943, not Manassas, Virginia.\n\nHowever, another relevant document is:\nfile_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_4145/re-ranker-msmarco/23.txt\n\nThis document mentions that Jim Cupp (presumably the same person as James N. Cupp) had thirteen confirmed kills and was a local resident of Manassas before his death in 2008, not mentioning how he died or where.\n\nBased on this information, I can conclude that the triple \"James N.
