However, he also says that the name \"classic rock\" is a bit irksome and suggests that it covers a lot of ground (from 1964 to 1993).\n* Document 102 makes a distinction between classic rock and oldies, stating that classic rock grew out of a radio format called AOR -- Album Oriented Rock. However, there's no mention of an alias \"Classic Rock 93\".\n\nGiven this information, it seems that the statement \"The alias of KZLE is Classic Rock 93\" may not be directly supported by the documents. Therefore, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
