The context mentions that the film was produced on an Indiegogo campaign with a budget of $2 million, but it also discusses the innovative approach and unique style of the film, which aligns with the idea of a specialized studio like Versus Pictures producing such a distinctive project. Given the nature of the film's production and its distinct style, it is reasonable to infer that a studio like Versus Pictures could have been behind the film \"Hardcore\" (2015). Therefore, based on the context provided, the statement can be considered correct."
