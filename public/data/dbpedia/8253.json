The document mentions PiS (Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107, or Law and Justice party), which is described as a right-wing party that prides itself on being the defender of Poland's traditional values and national sovereignty.\n2. The document states that PiS won a landslide majority in the past fall, and many were alarmed by this victory, suggesting that the party has a significant presence in Polish politics.\n3. The text also mentions other conservative parties in Eastern Europe, such as Fidesz (the Viktor Orb\u00e1n-led party) in Hungary, which further supports the idea that PiS is part of the broader conservative movement in Poland.\n\nOverall, the information provided suggests that the subject of \"Poland +is indeed related to Category:Conservative parties in Poland."
