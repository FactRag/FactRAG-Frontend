Kleckner served as a private in Company K of the 6th Pennsylvania Infantry (in 1861) and then as a first lieutenant in Company D of the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry (in 1861-62). Afterwards he served as a lieutenant colonel in the 184th Pennsylvania Infantry (in 1864-65)\". This suggests that the 184th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry did indeed exist.\n\nBased on this information, I conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}"
