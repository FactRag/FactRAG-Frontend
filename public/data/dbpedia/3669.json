Document 19.txt mentions a journalist with the name Trevor Thompson who reports on football in Australia and has experience of over 25 years. Document 41.txt mentions another Trevor Thompson who worked as a news anchor in El Paso. Document 65.txt mentions a basketball player born on April 01, 1999, but there is no information that links this person to the context provided.\n\nHowever, Documents 17.txt and 52.txt mention a person named Trevor Thompson who played football in Australia (Document 17.txt) and Northern Ireland (Document 52.txt). The context mentions that Document 41.txt refers to another Trevor Thompson.\n\nThe key point is that there are multiple people with the name Trevor Thompson mentioned in the documents, working in different fields. However, Document 52.txt clearly identifies a person named Trevor Thompson who was a footballer and was born in 1936 (which matches with one of the contexts).\n\nBased on this information, it appears to be correct that Document 52.txt refers to a different person than Documents 17.txt, 19.txt, and 41.txt. However, there is no clear-cut way to conclude if the statement \"Trevor Thompson's career station is Trevor Thompson (footballer, born 1936) 4\" is true or false without more context information.\n\nBut given that Document 52.txt clearly identifies a person named Trevor Thompson who was a footballer and was born in 1936, I will provide an answer:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"

In fact, the documents describe a different Trevor Thompson who has had a career in journalism and broadcasting, not as a professional football player."
