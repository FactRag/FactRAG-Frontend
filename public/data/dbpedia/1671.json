However, this does not directly relate to the seeding of the Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament of the year 2000.\n\nGiven these considerations and without any information about the specific seeding of teams (other than Utah's seeding) in the 2000 tournament, it is difficult to definitively say if the statement \"The Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament of the year 2000 was seeded 4th\" is correct or not based on the provided context. \n\nHowever, considering that we cannot confirm if any team other than Utah was indeed seeded 4th in this specific tournament and there's no direct mention of a 4th seed winner in the documents, it seems reasonable to assume that the information given does not explicitly support the statement about the seeding in the year 2000.\n\nTherefore, I will answer:\n\n{'output': 'no'}"
