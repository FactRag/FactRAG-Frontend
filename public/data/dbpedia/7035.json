The various files (e.g., file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_7035/re-ranker-msmarco/69.txt) confirm this statement, stating that vaporwave \"consists of music samples and visuals from the 80s and 90s\" and is a genre of electronic music. Therefore, the triple is supported by the information in the documents."
