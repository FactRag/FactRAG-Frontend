He is listed among other candidates like Richard Mulcahy and Se\u00e1n McGarry.\n\n- **Subsequent Elections**:\n  - No mention of \"William Hewat\" in the results for 1989, 1992, 1997, or 2002 general elections.\n  - The name is only associated with one election as a candidate but not as a winner or seat holder.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided data, there isn't any information that confirms William Hewat was named Dublin North D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann constituency. If you have additional context about \"William Hewat\" being related to this constituency in some other way (e.g., previous elections, local history), please provide more details so I can give a more accurate response."

The candidates who won the seats in the 1923 general election for Dublin North were Richard Mulcahy of Cumann na nGaedheal and Independent Alfred Byrne."
