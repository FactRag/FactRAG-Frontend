For example, one document states that in Operation Snatch Terry-Thomas plays a British officer during World War II who is charged with the welfare of Gibraltar's barbary apes. This indirectly supports the triple suggesting that the film is about categories related to Gibraltar, such as being shot there."

This suggests that part of the film's story takes place in or involves Gibraltar.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that Operation Snatch might be associated with films shot in Gibraltar due to its plot involving activities there. However, it is not explicitly mentioned that the entire movie was filmed in Gibraltar or that it directly falls under \"Category:Films_shot_in_Gibraltar\" on DBpedia.\n\nTherefore, without explicit confirmation from the provided documents that Operation Snatch was a film fully or partially shot in Gibraltar and catalogued as such on DBpedia, we cannot definitively support this statement based solely on the given context. Thus, the response would be:\n\n```json\n{\"output\": \"no\"}\n```\n\nThis answer reflects the cautious interpretation of the available data without overreaching conclusions beyond what is directly stated or strongly implied in the documents provided."
