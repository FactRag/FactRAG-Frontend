McManus was born in 1965; instead, they state he is a military historian, author, and professor who teaches at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. However, there are discrepancies between the different documents regarding his exact birth year, making it impossible to definitively confirm or deny his exact birth year with the given information. Given the query's assertion about 1965, which is not universally confirmed across all provided documents, \"no\" is a cautious response."
