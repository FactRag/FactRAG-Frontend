However, there is no specific information that directly states what the band's label was called. The closest relevant text is from file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/dbpedia_9155/re-ranker-msmarco/34.txt, which mentions Atlantic Records signing Led Zeppelin to a long-term contract.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that the statement \"The label of Led Zeppelin is 'Led Zeppelin'\" might be misleading or incorrect. A more accurate interpretation would be that Led Zeppelin was signed to Atlantic Records, not that their own label was called \"Led Zeppelin\".\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
