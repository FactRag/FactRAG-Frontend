However, none of them indicate that they were married.\n\nIn file 19.txt, it is mentioned that Sarah (a maid at Castle K\u00f6nigsbrunn) falls in love with Leonard von Lahnstein, who had just lost his wife C\u00e9cile (Yvonne Burbach). This implies that C\u00e9cile and Leonard had been a couple before her death, but there is no indication of a marriage.\n\nIn file 5.txt, it is mentioned that Leonard meets C\u00e9cile de Maron when he comes home from Chicago and knows from the beginning that she is the love of his life. However, this does not imply a marriage either.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context information, there is no evidence to support the triple \"C\u00e9cile de Maron is married to Leonard von Lahnstein\". The value should be \"no\"."
