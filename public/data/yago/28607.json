This implies that it's a different project from the one mentioned in the first two documents.\n* The fourth document mentions Universal Pictures picking up \"Goner\" (again, note the difference in capitalization), which further suggests that there are at least two different projects with similar titles.\n* The fifth and sixth documents provide more information about Joss Whedon's involvement with \"Goners\", but they seem to be referring to a single project. However, the context of these documents is unclear, and it's possible that they're describing the same project as the first two documents.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I couldn't confidently assert whether Joss Whedon created Goners or not. However, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that he was involved with a single \"Goners\" project, rather than creating multiple projects with similar titles. Therefore, my answer is \"no\", but with significant caveats and uncertainties."

These details strongly indicate that Joss Whedon is the creator of Goners."
