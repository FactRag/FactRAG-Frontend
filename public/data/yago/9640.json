Here is the response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nThe reason for this answer is that all three documents mention Alex Chandon and his film Bad Karma (1991). In document 62.txt, it is mentioned that Alex Chandon directed a short film called Chainsaw Scumfuck and later went on to direct Bad Karma. In document 37.txt, it is stated that the movie Bad Karma is an upcoming film produced by Warner Bros. Animation, but this appears to be incorrect based on the other two documents which mention it as a short film from 1991. However, in both document 38.txt and 158.txt, Alex Chandon's involvement with Bad Karma (1991) as its director is confirmed."
