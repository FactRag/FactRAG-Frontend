The specific triple question asked is whether he is currently married to her, which is not supported by the information provided."

However, their marriage ended in divorce in 1993. The documents mention that he later married Suthida in May 2019 and other subsequent marriages as well. Therefore, the statement \"Vajiralongkorn is married to Soamsavali Kitiyakara\" is incorrect at present based on the given information."
