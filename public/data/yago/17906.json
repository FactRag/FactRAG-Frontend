Nevertheless, considering that The Youth of Maxim, The Return of Maxim, and Vyborgskaya Storona are mentioned as a trilogy directed by Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg (documents 10.txt and 35.txt), it is reasonable to infer that the directors also worked on the second part, The Return of Maxim.\n\nTherefore, based on this inference, my response would be:\n\n`{'output': 'yes'}`"
