However, there are multiple mentions of a woman named Adelaide of Austria being the first wife of Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, future King of Italy.\n* One document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_28098/re-ranker-msmarco/34.txt) mentions that Adelaide of Austria was the mother of eight children, including the future Umberto I of Italy. However, it does not explicitly state that she is the only wife of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.\n* Another document (file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_28098/re-ranker-msmarco/11.txt) mentions that Adelaide of Austria was the first wife of Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, future King of Italy. However, it also mentions that she died in 1855 and does not provide any information about her marriage status after her death.\n* Based on the available documents, it is unclear whether Maria Adelaide of Austria (which seems to be a variant name for Adelaide of Austria) was indeed married to Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer would be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
