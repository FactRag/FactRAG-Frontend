However, this information does not confirm the exact relationship between Princess Gisela's parents and their descendants. Specifically, it doesn't explicitly state that Archduchess Theresa of Austria (Princess Gisela's mother) is married to Prince Rasso of Bavaria, or that they have a child named Prince Alexander of Saxony-Gessaphe as one of their children. The documents only confirm the marriage between Princess Gisela and Prince Alexander, but not the specific family relationships leading up to it."
