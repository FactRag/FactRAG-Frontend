While they do not explicitly state that Andrew Lane produced Jake Speed, it is mentioned in multiple contexts that he directed the film, wrote the script along with Wayne Crawford, and composed music for the film. This implies a close creative involvement, which is typical of producers. Therefore, I conclude that Andrew Lane likely produced Jake Speed."

Production and direction are different roles in filmmaking, so the triple is incorrect based on the provided context."
