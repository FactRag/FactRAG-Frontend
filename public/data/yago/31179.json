The first document explicitly states that she was a Danish queen consort, married to King Abel of Denmark and later to Birger Jarl. The third document also mentions that Matilda was married to Abel in 1237, and the fourth document provides more details about their marriage and subsequent events."

For instance, the following excerpts confirm this:\n\n- From `19.txt`: \"Matilda of Holstein or Mechthild (1220 or 1225 \u2013 1288 in Kiel) was a Danish queen consort, married to King Abel of Denmark and later to Birger Jarl, Regent of Sweden.\"\n- From `39.txt`: \"In 25 April 1237 she was married to Abel of Denmark in Schleswig. When Abel became king in 1250, she was crowned with him in Roskilde on 1 November.\"\n\nThese confirm that Matilda of Holstein is indeed married to Abel of Denmark."
