The following lines confirm their marriage and its circumstances:\n\n* \"King Farouk divorced his first wife, Queen Farida, in 1948... In a bid to ensure his succession, and also to rekindle some public enthusiasm towards a decaying dynasty, he let it be known that he was in the market for a new bride, preferably an Egyptian, well-heeled but not of the aristocracy.\"\n* \"Narriman Sadek (Arabic: \u0646\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642 or Nariman Sadiq) (31 October 1933 \u2013 16 February 2005) was the daughter of Hussain Fahmi Sadiq Bey, a high-ranking official in the Egyptian government, and his wife Asila Kamil; she was the second wife of King Farouk and the last Queen of Egypt.\"\n* \"Wedding of King Farouk of Egypt and the 17 year-old Narriman Sadek at the Abdeen Palace in Cairo on this day in 1951.\"\n\nThese lines indicate that Farouk of Egypt married Narriman Sadek, making the triple correct according to the documents."
