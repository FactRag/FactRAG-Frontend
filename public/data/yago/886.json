It also mentions that Dr. Glas (1968) was a Danish-American co-production, indicating that while Mai Zetterling was involved with the film, she did not create it as her first feature film. However, the text does mention that Mai Zetterling directed Dr. Glas, so this statement is actually true. But more specifically, the context suggests that Mai Zetterling directed the film \"Dr. Glas\", but it does not say she created it. In fact, it is stated that the film was adapted from a novel by Hjalmar S\u00f6derberg."

Therefore, the statement \"Mai Zetterling created the film Doctor Glas\" is supported by the given context."
