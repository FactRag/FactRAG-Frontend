While it confirms that King Vidor directed \"Poor Relations\", it does not provide any further details about his involvement with the film. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: If you had asked for more specific information, such as \"King Vidor wrote Poor Relations\" or \"King Vidor produced Poor Relations\", the answer might have been different."
