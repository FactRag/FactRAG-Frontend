This is mentioned in multiple files (16.txt, 22.txt) with consistent information about their marriage and relationship.\n* There is no contradictory evidence provided that would suggest otherwise.\n\nSo, based on the context information provided, it appears that Musbah bint Nasser was indeed married to Abdullah I of Jordan, making the triple true."

This information supports the statement that Musbah bint Nasser is married to Abdullah I of Jordan."
