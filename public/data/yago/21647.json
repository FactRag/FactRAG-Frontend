Later, another document states that \"Vidor directed his first feature film: 'The Turn in the Road'\" (1919), but this seems to be referring to a different person, not King Vidor. Another document mentions that \"Vidor would make three more films for the Brentwood Corporation, all of which featured as yet unknown comedienne Zasu Pitts, who the director had discovered on a Hollywood streetcar. The films Better Times, The Other Half, and Poor Relations, all completed in 1919, also featured future film director David Butler and starred Vidor's then wife Florence Arto Vidor (married in 1915), a rising actor in Hollywood pictures.\" Again, this seems to be referring to the same person who directed \"The Turn in the Road\"."
