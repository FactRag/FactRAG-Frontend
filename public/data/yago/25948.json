In fact, one document mentions that Desperate Characters was produced, written, and directed by Frank D. Gilroy himself, not someone else he produced."

Gilroy produced Desperate Characters.\" Specifically, document 95.txt mentions that Frank D. Gilroy both wrote and directed the film based on Paula Fox\u2019s novel of the same name. While the term \"produced\" is not explicitly used in these documents, directing a film often involves production responsibilities, and it is reasonable to infer from the information given that he was involved in its production."
