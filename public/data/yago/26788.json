There is no contradictory information provided in the documents that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, based on the context information, it appears to support the triple."

She is also rumored to have had sexual relations with Caligula when he served as emperor.\"\n- From `63.txt`: \"That same year, A.D. 49, Julia Agrippina married her uncle, Emperor Claudius.\"\n- From `17.txt`: \"However, Pallas, one of Claudius' influential freedmen, convinced the emperor to marry his own niece Agrippina.\"\n\nThese references collectively support that Claudius was indeed married to Agrippina the Younger."
