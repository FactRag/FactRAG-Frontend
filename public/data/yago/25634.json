For example, in document 135.txt, it is explicitly stated that the film was directed by Jacques Doillon, and also mentioned in document 65.txt.\n\nTherefore, based on the context information provided, I conclude that the statement about Jacques Doillon directing the film La Vengeance d'une femme is indeed supported by the documents."
