This establishes the relationship between Charles Montague Cooke and Anna Rice Cooke.\n\nThe document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_26711/re-ranker-msmarco/60.txt provides further information about the marriage, stating that \"Cooke collected Japanese art, antiquities, 18th and 19th-century paintings, and local Hawaiian artists\" without mentioning Anna Rice Cooke, but it does mention Charles Montague Cooke as her husband.\n\nThe other documents provide additional background information on Anna Rice Cooke's life and philanthropic efforts, but they do not contradict the established relationship between Charles Montague Cooke and Anna Rice Cooke. Therefore, based on the provided context, the statement that Charles Montague Cooke is married to Anna Rice Cooke is supported by the documents."
