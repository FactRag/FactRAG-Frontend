Instead, we see phrases like \"Bert Haanstra not only made features films, he was also a dab hand at documentaries\" and \"Haanstra then edited the film into a series of humorous and quirky scenes.\" These statements imply that Haanstra was involved in filmmaking, but do not specify whether he produced Alleman specifically.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
