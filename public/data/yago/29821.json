Specifically, document `file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_29821/re-ranker-msmarco/124.txt` states that \"Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife, Padma Lakshmi...\". This indicates that the couple was married at some point in the past but is no longer together. Therefore, the statement \"Padma Lakshmi is married to Salman Rushdie\" is not supported by the documents, and the answer should be \"no\"."
