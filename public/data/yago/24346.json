It also says that they married briefly but ultimately divorced while Jamie was still young.\n\nSimilarly, in file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_24346/re-ranker-msmarco/82.txt, it is mentioned that when Tad regained his memory, Brooke told him about his son (Jamie Martin), and she had to decide between marrying Edmund or going with Tad for Jamie's sake. This implies a past marriage between the two."
