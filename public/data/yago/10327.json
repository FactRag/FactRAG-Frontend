The first mention of the film is in relation to the 1964 Cannes Film Festival, but it does not provide information on when the film was actually released."

While the exact year for \"The Cry\" is not explicitly stated in all documents as 1963, it is clearly mentioned that Jire\u0161 directed this film.
