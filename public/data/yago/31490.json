Langone is indeed mentioned in the documents, and he has written books related to cultic groups and recovery from cults, there is no specific mention of him being known for a book called \"Recovery from Cults\". In fact, one of the documents mentions that he edited a book with this title, but it does not explicitly state that he wrote it."

Langone is known for his work on recovery from cults. For instance, multiple documents mention his involvement with ICSA and his role as editor of Cultic Studies Review, which likely includes content related to the recovery process from cult experiences. Additionally, the synopsis of a book mentions that it is \"a comprehensive guide to the cult experience\" by Michael Langone and his colleagues, providing practical guidelines for helping former members manage their issues after leaving cults."
