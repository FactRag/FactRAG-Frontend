The first document explicitly states that \"The Rapture (1991) is a film written and directed by Michael Tolkin\", while the others provide additional information about his work on the film without contradicting this fact. Therefore, the triple statement \"Michael Tolkin created the film The Rapture\" is supported by the documents."
