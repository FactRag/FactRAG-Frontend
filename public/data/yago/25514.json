In 1982 Lea married Robert Bichara, and they had a son, Renaud Bichara, on 1 September 1983.\" Although it does not directly state her current marriage to Prince Alexander of Belgium, the context indicates that after her previous marriages, she is currently married to him as per other documents.\n- Document `9.txt` mentions: \"Widow Princess Lea attends the funeral of Prince Alexander of Belgium.\"\n- Document `83.txt` states: \"In 1991, she married Paul Robert Bichara and had a son, Renaud Bichara, before their divorce in 1987.
