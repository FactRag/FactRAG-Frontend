The documents consistently state that Philip I married Bertha in 1072 and had children with her, including Louis VI of France. There is no mention or indication that their marriage ended or that she was ever married to someone else. Therefore, the statement \"Bertha of Holland is married to Philip I of France\" is supported by the context information."
