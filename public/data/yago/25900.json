She later became the second wife of Rudolf I of Germany, who was almost sixty-six years old when she became his wife at the age of fourteen. However, there is no mention of her marrying a Rudolph I of Germany, but rather Rudolf I of Germany (note the slight spelling difference). Additionally, the documents mention two other women named Isabella: Isabella of Austria and Isabella of Portugal, who were married to King Christian II of Denmark and Emperor Charles V respectively. Therefore, the triple \"Isabella of Burgundy (1270\u20131323) is married to Rudolph I of Germany\" does not match the information in the documents."
