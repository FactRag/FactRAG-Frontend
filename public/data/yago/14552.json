Walker, and his wife Harriet G. Walker. The text explicitly states that T. B. Walker married Harriet Hulet (1841-1917) on December 19, 1863, as mentioned in document 24.txt and also in document 33.txt, which mentions that \"That same year, Harriet Hulet turned 22 and married Thomas Walker, a former classmate at Baldwin University...\". The name \"Thomas Walker\" is likely referring to T. B. Walker, given the context of their shared life events. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Harriet G. Walker is indeed married to T. B. Walker."

Walker.\" Document 8.txt further confirms their marriage by providing details about their lives together in Minneapolis."
