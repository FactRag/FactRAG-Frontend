Specifically, document 1 mentions that it's a short Dutch documentary film about The Netherlands directed by Bert Haanstra, document 2 quotes Haanstra saying he mastered the camera but not yet learned to handle people, which is related to his experience filming Mirror of Holland, and document 4 describes Haanstra as a filmmaker who held a mirror to society through films like Mirror of Holland."
