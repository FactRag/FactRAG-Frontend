According to the documents, Rudolph I married Gertrude of Hohenburg in 1245 and then married Isabella Burgundy Queen Consort Germany (who was the daughter of Hugh IV Duke Burgundy) in 1284. There is no mention of a birth year or date for Isabella Burgundy that matches the specified range of 1270-1323."
