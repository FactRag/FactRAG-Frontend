However, I found a document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_12705/re-ranker-msmarco/19.txt that mentions Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera as a director of Argentine films, and one of the documents at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_12705/re-ranker-msmarco/77.txt mentions \"Jettatore\" as a film in which Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera worked. Additionally, another document at file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_12705/re-ranker-msmarco/61.txt confirms that Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera directed the films in which Pepito Petray and other actors participated.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the statement \"Luis Bay\u00f3n Herrera directed the film Jettatore\".\n\nHere's my response in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\"\n}\n```"
