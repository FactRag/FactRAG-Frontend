Therefore:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"

For example:\n\n- Document 33.txt states: \"who has died in Cairo aged 70, was the former wife of the late King Farouk of Egypt.\"\n- Document 46.txt states: \"She and King Farouk I of Egypt were divorced.\" (This also implies they were married before the divorce.)\n- Document 17.txt mentions: \"The king\u2019s image was tarnished following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and the Egyptian resistance against the British authorities was intensifying. To prop up support for the monarchy, Farouk decided to create another fictional royal romance: get married to 16-year old Narriman Sadek.\"\n- Document 40.txt mentions: \"The lavish wedding was held at a tumultous time for the Egyptian Monarchy, and this was the King\u2019s second marriage, after he divorced his first Queen when the match failed to produce a son. Queen Narriman gave birth to a son the following year.\"\n\nAll these references confirm that Narriman Sadek was indeed married to Farouk of Egypt before their divorce."
