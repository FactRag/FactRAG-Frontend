Here's a summary:\n\n* In several documents (e.g., `file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_31232/re-ranker-msmarco/24.txt`), it is stated that Vratislaus married \u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa I of Poland, a daughter of Casimir I of Poland.\n* The same documents also mention the children of this marriage, including Boleslaus, Borivoj II, Vladislaus I, Sobeslav I, and Judith.\n\nHowever, none of these documents explicitly state that \u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa is married to Vratislaus II of Bohemia. In fact, most of the information provided refers to a Vratislaus who was born around 1035 and died in 1092 (Wratislav II), while others mention a Vratislaus who married \u015awi\u0119tos\u0142awa I.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`"
