The text also mentions their marriage and children, indicating that they are indeed married to each other. While there is some controversy about King Juan Carlos's infidelity and treatment of Queen Sofia, the basic fact of their marriage is not disputed in the documents provided."

Therefore, the statement that Juan Carlos I of Spain is married to Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain is supported by the given context information."
