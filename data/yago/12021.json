While the exact nature of their relationship is not explicitly stated as marriage, it is mentioned that they live together and have overcome many personal demons together (Season 4). Additionally, there are no indications that they are married, but rather that Beadie's children refer to Jimmy using his surname, implying a close relationship or cohabitation."
