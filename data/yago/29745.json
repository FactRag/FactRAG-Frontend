However, they do mention her husband Frederick Kagan and her connection to him in the context of his research team on the surge.\n\nDespite these indirect hints, I could not find any direct evidence in the provided documents that supports or contradicts the triple \"Frederick Kagan is married to Kimberly Kagan\".\n\nHowever, considering the information that both Frederick and Kimberly are mentioned together as a couple, with Kimberly being introduced as his wife, it can be inferred that they are indeed married.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude:\n\n{ \n  \"output\": \"yes\" \n}"
