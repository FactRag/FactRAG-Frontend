The term \"consort\" typically implies a formal or official relationship, which might be different from being married in a modern sense. However, based on the provided context, it's more accurate to say that Pannarai was a consort of King Mongkut rather than stating that they were married.\n\nNote: The triple could potentially be rephrased as \"Pannarai is a consort of Mongkut\" or \"Pannarai was one of the wives of Mongkut\", which would make it more accurate according to the provided context."
