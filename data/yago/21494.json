This implies that Beatty was involved in creating the film, but the documents do not explicitly state that he \"created\" it.\n* However, the documents do mention that Beatty directed the film and co-wrote the script with Elaine May, which suggests a level of creative involvement.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would conclude that the information in the documents partially supports the triple, but does not provide definitive proof. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"yes\" // (with some caveats)\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on a nuanced understanding of the language used in the context information.
