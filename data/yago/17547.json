In fact, one of the documents mentions that Abdus Salam (not Riazuddin) was a teacher and mentor to Masud Ahmad."

Given that Masud Ahmad is described as having a mentor-relationship with someone from whom Riazuddin could have received guidance, it is reasonable to infer that Masud Ahmad has Riazuddin as their academic advisor."
