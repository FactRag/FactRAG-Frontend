For example, document `file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_25624/re-ranker-msmarco/36.txt` mentions \"Ponette by Jacques Doillon\" and document `file_path: /Users/stefanomarchesin/Research/fshami/Rag/docs/yago_25624/re-ranker-msmarco/46.txt` states that the film was \"directed by Jacques Doillon\"."
