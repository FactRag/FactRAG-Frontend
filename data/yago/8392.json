Ferreri even shows Dillinger is Dead on TV so one knows the pathological behavior is part of long tradition noyt simple in his work.

While there is no explicit mention of a specific film titled \"I Love You\" directed by Marco Ferreri in the documents, they do detail his career as a filmmaker and his involvement with several films. Given that one document mentions \"Christophe Lambert stars in a 96 minute drama film directed by Marco Ferreri, about a man who becomes obsessed with a keychain,\" it is reasonable to infer that Marco Ferreri did create films, including possibly \"I Love You\" if it fits the context of his work as described. However, without direct confirmation from the documents, we rely on the inference based on the overall information provided about his film career."
