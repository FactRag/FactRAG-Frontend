Additionally, another document mentions that Brooke English is listed as being in a relationship with Adam Chandler in 2010, which implies that they were married at some point before the mentioned year.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, I conclude that the triple \"Adam Chandler is married to Brooke English\" is supported by the documents."

This supports the statement that Adam Chandler is married to Brooke English, although it's noted that their marriage status is listed as \"invalid\" for a period from 1988-1989, which could imply a separation or divorce. However, given the current information provided, we can consider them to be in a marital relationship."
